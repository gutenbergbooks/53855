<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r10" />
<div class="preface">

<p class="noindent">The following work is the result of six years’
residence in the Peninsula, devoted to literary
pursuits. It contains the fruits (be they mature
or otherwise) of many excursions through Spain
and Portugal, of considerable opportunities of
observation, and much familiarity with localities
and people, as well as of meditative habits in an
isolated life, which during the last three years
especially has been compelled by severe sickness.
Love and admiration of the British Islands,
whose climate would be fatal to me, except during
two or three summer months, have been fostered
by constrained absence; and my attention having
been strongly turned to the great Peninsular
struggle, I have consulted every accessible work,
and every surviving authority within my reach,
that could illustrate a theme with which my mind
has been filled for years. While I have endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
to sustain the glory of England, I have
striven to award a meed of truthful but generous
justice to her Allies, and have not thought it
requisite to depreciate the well-earned fame of
France. Yet, even while celebrating the most
splendid military achievements, it has been my
aim to inculcate a horror of the bloody arbitrament
of War.</p>

<p>Determined to perfect the work, so far as in me
lay, I last year traversed the whole Peninsula from
East to West, at the constant risk of a very
precarious life (which might thus, perhaps, become
not utterly valueless), and acquired the
advantages to be derived to my labours from visiting
the following battle-grounds:&mdash;Bayonne and
the Adour, the Nive, St. Pierre, the Nivelle, the
Bidasoa, San Marcial, Vera, Sauroren, San Sebastian,
Vitoria, Talavera, Almaraz, Albuera, and
Badajoz, having previously visited most of the
battle-fields in Portugal and in Northern and
Southern Spain.</p>

<p>The task which I have undertaken, and accomplished
according to my means, was an ambitious
one, yet honourable. I scarcely dare to hope for
success. I feel the full force of the immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
Scott’s address to the illustrious Wellington, in
the Introduction to his <cite>Vision of Don Roderick</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse2">But we weak minstrels of a laggard day,</p>

<p class="noindent">But, while I regard with befitting humility the
result of this labour of love, I trust that the
spirit in which I have conceived and written has
at least been pure and irreproachable.</p>

<p>It is with feelings of the utmost satisfaction and
pride that I notice, contemporaneously with the
appearance of this work, the concession of a
medal to our Peninsular veterans by the high-minded
Sovereign of England, whose propitious
name and reign are identified with victory:&mdash;</p>

subserviency. The wedding-ring may replace the
sword, but the instrument, because less bloody,
is not less fatal to Liberty; and the words of

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Of all the great achievements which make up the sum
of British glory, the Peninsular War and its results form
one of the grandest, brightest, and most unimpeachable.
These gigantic efforts were made in the holy cause of
Freedom; they were disinterested in a high and unparalleled
degree; their success was uniform, brilliant, and startling;
and their guerdon was the liberation and advancement of
mankind.</p>

<p>For six years England had constantly employed in the
Spanish Peninsula from thirty to seventy thousand of her
troops, who besides sustaining combats innumerable, took
four great fortresses, attacked or defended in ten important
sieges, and were decisively victorious in nineteen pitched
battles, killing, wounding, or making prisoners, two hundred
thousand of the enemy. She liberally subsidized Spain
and Portugal, and maintained the troops of both countries,
regular and irregular, with supplies of ammunition, clothing,
and arms, while upon her own military operations she
expended upwards of one hundred millions sterling. Twice
she expelled the French from Portugal, and finally drove
them from Spain besides, surmounting and winning step
by step the terrific bulwark of the Pyrenees. With her
naval squadrons she repeatedly harassed the Invader by
well-combined descents upon the coasts, and rescued or
preserved Lisbon and Cadiz, Alicante and Carthagena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Her land forces tracked the enemy from Vimieiro to Busaco,
from Busaco to Navarre, over some of the most frightfully
broken ground in Europe, signally defeating them wherever
they came in collision, and sweeping them at times like
a wreck before the ocean-wave; and forty thousand of her
children fell in the Peninsula to attest her devotion to the
cause of Freedom.</p>

<p>In this most memorable liberation of Spain from the
French invader, it is the glory of England to have realized
with singular exactness the splendid encomium of Livy:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Esse aliquam in terris gentem quæ suâ impensâ, suo
labore ac periculo, bella gerat pro libertate aliorum. Nec
hoc finitimis, aut propinquæ vicinitatis hominibus, aut terris
continenti junctis præstet. Maria trajiciat: ne quod toto
orbe terrarum injustum imperium sit, et ubique jus, fas, lex,
potentissima sint.</span>”&mdash;<cite>Hist. lib.</cite> xxxiii.</p>

<p>The pre-eminent importance of the War of Independence
in Spain, and of the part which England took in that
struggle, has been acknowledged by rival French writers,
whose love of historic truth was too strong for the countervailing
influences of prejudice, passion, and professional
jealousy. M. Thiers, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat et de
l’Empire</cite>, speaks of it as “that long and terrible struggle,
that great Peninsular war, which lasted more than six
years, which exhausted more treasure and drained off a
greater tide of human blood than the murderous campaign
of Russia, and in which all the most renowned generals and
marshals of France were severally defeated, to the surprise
of Napoléon, and to the astonishment of the world, by an
English general, newly returned from India, whose name
was as yet almost a stranger to every mouth.”</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle était à juste titre désignée comme la cause première
et principale de la chute de Napoléon,</span>” is the remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of General Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Guerre de la Péninsule.
Avant-propos</cite>. And in one of his private letters he says,
“Moscow brought Alexander, Spain brought Wellington,
into the walls of our sacred city!”</p>

<p>I am therefore sure of the intrinsic interest of my
subject, and am tremulous only about its treatment. Of
this much I at least am certain&mdash;that no one will exclaim,
as Horace did 2,000 years ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse8">&mdash;&mdash;“Quis feræ</p>
<p class="verse">Bellum curet Iberiæ?”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">or be indifferent to the exploits of Englishmen in a
country, with whose people the same Horace coupled a
most flattering epithet&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peritus Iber</i>.” The splendour
and the decadence, the glory and misfortunes, the ancient
grandeur and the existing distresses of Spain, the great
historic parts which we have played either in unison or
in rivalry,&mdash;above all, the terrible struggle which we maintained
together against a Power with which it was at first
despair to cope, and yet brought to a triumphant issue,
make it impossible that any record of that struggle can be
received with indifference; and the customary fate of
rashness and incompetency is the only one that I have to
apprehend.</p>

<p>That these great and glorious exploits should not have
hitherto formed the subject of any extended poem may at
first appear surprising. But the reason is obvious&mdash;the
time had not yet arrived. The glare of contemporary
fame is unfavourable to poetic celebration, except in the
form of Pindar’s Olympionics, in dithyrambic odes imbued
with the intoxication of victory, or otherwise in such short
reflective sonnets as embodied a Wordsworth’s calm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
philosophic spirit. The mists of time must be interposed
before the hero rises to the Demigod, an entirely new generation
must have succeeded, and the poet must himself
belong to that generation. The halo of Imagination must
invest what was before Reality, the subject must have attained
the dignity of the <em>myth</em>, or heroic legend, and Ideal
Art must be unencumbered by the pressure of the Actual.
That time appears to have arrived. Forty years have
elapsed since the commencement of this mighty struggle;
those of our Peninsular heroes whom the shock of battle
spared, have nearly all been gathered to their fathers, and
those who remain are like late surviving Nestors whose
heads are crowned with the snowy tonsure of Time.</p>

<p>Into the construction of this poem it is unfit that I should
enter further than to state, that the action, which is in
some degree formed on the purest ancient model, comprises
a period of about two months, commencing a month
before and ending a month after the taking of San Sebastian
by storm. The besieged city forms the central point,
and the events there, with superadded imaginative incidents,
are combined with the fighting round San Sebastian, of
which the object was on one side to relieve, and on the
other to prevent the relief of that fortress. These are what
are usually known by the name of the Battles of the
Pyrenees, and commenced with the first battle of Sauroren,
which was fought on the 28th July, 1813; the storming of
San Sebastian occurred on the 31st of August; and the action
of the poem concludes with the passage of the Bidassoa,
and the advance of the Allied Army to the Greater Rhune,
by which the Spanish soil was freed from the presence of
the Invader&mdash;events which occurred on the 7th and 8th of
October. The second siege of San Sebastian commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
contemporaneously with the first battle of Sauroren, on the
28th July.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The actual time therefore employed in the
action is precisely two months and twelve days. The
battles of the Pyrenees introduced are essentially interwoven
with the main subject, which is the capture of the great
fortress of San Sebastian, the principal event of the latter
part of the War while it was confined to the Spanish soil.
All the characters are grouped by the story round the
central figure of the besieged city, the incidents of the
<em>peripeteia</em> or plot are interwoven with that event and with
each other, and&mdash;if it be not presumption to use such
a word&mdash;the <em>Epos</em> is complete. The critics, I have no
doubt, will find abundant faults; and the rest I commit to
their tender mercies.</p>

<p>Though the time, as essential to such compositions, is
in comparison with the duration of the War extremely
limited, all its leading incidents are introduced in the
permitted shapes of narrative, episode, allusion, and
apostrophe. The historical part of the work invites the
closest examination, as well as the local colouring, to which
a six years’ constant residence in the Peninsula has enabled
me, I trust, to impart some truth and vivacity. I have
lived in the midst of revolts, revolutions, and military
movements; my experience almost equals that of an actual
campaigner; and I have witnessed even portions of three
sieges&mdash;those of Seville and Barcelona in 1843, and that
of Almeida in Portugal in 1844. Copious historical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
explanatory notes are annexed to each canto, and the description
of the battle grounds is made accurate by personal
observation of many of them, which I have embodied in
the notes. The theatre of that portion of the War which
enters into the action of the poem itself presents very
felicitous subjects for description, the ground being the
gigantic Pyrenees, and the combats there sustained being
more like those of Titans than of men. In addition to
much oral testimony, the authorities I have consulted are
very numerous, and as fidelity has been my constant aim
their language will be found frequently cited in the notes.
The principal of these are Napier’s <cite>History of the War
in the Peninsula</cite>, Southey’s <cite>History of the Peninsular
War</cite>, Foy’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Guerre de la Péninsule</cite>, Gurwood’s
<cite>Despatches of the Duke of Wellington</cite>, Jones’s
<cite>Journals of the Sieges in Spain</cite>, Belmas’s <cite>Journals of
Sieges</cite>, compiled from official documents by order of the
French government, Captain Cooke’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>, Captain
Pringle’s <cite>Ditto</cite>, Captain Batty’s <cite>Campaign of the left
Wing of the Allied Army in the Western Pyrenees</cite>, Gleig’s
<cite>Subaltern, Annals of the Peninsular War</cite>, De la Pène’s
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Campagnes de 1813 et 1814</cite>, and Pellot’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires des
Campagnes des Pyrénées</cite>.</p>

<p>A difficulty inseparable from this subject is its great
historical and political interest, which although in one
respect an advantage in another is a considerable drawback.
With events so well known and comparatively so
recent it is impossible to take liberties; invention is restrained,
and the imagination is confined within limits more
strict than the poetical faculty might desire for its operations.
If this objection has been felt with regard to
Tasso’s <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gerusalemme</i>, the personages of which were French
and Italian counts and princes familiar to the reader of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
general history, and whose acts and characters were well
known though they lived four centuries before he wrote, it
is clearly far more applicable in the present instance. The
answer at once is that an entirely different treatment must
be resorted to, that celestial machinery, witchcraft, and all
analogous means must be excluded, and that actual truth
must be made the basis of the whole composition. To
truth I have accordingly adhered, and invite the strictest
historical criticism, consistent with poetical diction and
imagery, of my account of these campaigns. The events
were fortunately of that brilliant description, and their
theatre, the Pyrenees, so essentially romantic, that the true
and the marvellous are here one and the same. Historical
accuracy is here an element of beauty; and my minor plot
is alone invented, yet is meant to be strictly probable.</p>

<p>Nearly the entire of our modern military system dates
from the commencement of the Peninsular War. The
cumbrous old system which fought a whole campaign for
a comfortable place for winter quarters (a great aim with
Turenne) was broken up rapidly by the vigour of Napoléon,
and our first débût under the Duke of York had
taught us that we must change our plan. In 1808, the
very year of our first victories in the Peninsula (Roriça and
Vimieiro) the use of hair-powder was for the first time discontinued
in the British army. Rifle corps were then first
formed&mdash;in the first instance as rather a hopeless experiment,
our soldiers having been deemed too slow and
heavy for this practice; but, as the result proved, with
perfect success. From the Polish lancers whom we first
saw at Albuera we borrowed the idea of our corps of
lancers, as we afterwards took from the French cuirassiers
the modern equipment of our lifeguards. The brilliant
appearance of our light dragoons astonished the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
on their first appearance in the Peninsula. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nos soldats,
frappés de l’élégance de l’habit des dragons légers, de leurs
casques brillants, de la tournure svelte des hommes et
des chevaux, leur avaient donné le nom de <em>lindors</em>.</span>”&mdash;Foy,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. 2. For this rather theatrical
display we substituted with better taste in 1813 an uniform
similar to that worn by the German light cavalry. The
Shrapnell shell, or spherical case shot, (the invention of
an English Colonel of that name) was used for the first
time during the Peninsular War with great effect.</p>

<p>Amongst the many great services performed by the
Peninsular War was raising the character of the British
soldier from a very low to a very high standard in the
national estimation. The plays of Wycherley, Congreve,
Vanbrugh, and Mrs. Centlivre, the tales of Fielding,
Smollett, and Defoe, and the graver essays of Dr. Johnson,
sufficiently demonstrate that in the time of those writers
military men were held in the lowest esteem. The conquerors
of Blenheim and of the Heights of Abraham were
currently regarded as debauchees, cutthroats, and dishonest
adventurers, and where a more gentlemanly exterior was
exhibited, it was commonly united to the silliest foppery.
Such from the Restoration to the end of the last century
was the common character even of the officers of our army,
and the ruffianly brutality of <em>Ensign Northerton</em> towards
<em>Tom Jones</em> was perfectly characteristic in an age when
undoubtedly it was too true that pimping too often
obtained commissions, and it was an accurate general
description to say of any chance-met couple of officers that
“one had been bred under an attorney, and the other was
son to the wife of a nobleman’s butler.” (<cite>History of a
Foundling</cite>, book vii. c. 12). Though there were undoubtedly
many officers then of a far superior class, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the high tone of chivalrous honour in our army, and the
general refinement and accomplishment of character, belong
to the present century. It is the great praise of the
British private soldier that his stubborn will and indomitable
energy, his cheerful discipline and unflinching valour,
carry him through the most brilliant exploits to a success
almost miraculously uniform, without any of those tangible
hopes of promotion which inspire the continental soldier.
Such noble and manful discharge of duty appears to merit
some more adequate reward than the possible working of
a miracle which may raise him from the ranks.</p>

<p>Wellington, in his admirable <cite>Despatches</cite>, says of the
army with which he won these Pyrenean victories: “I
think I could do any thing with them.” The resemblance
of many portions of these remarkable compositions to
those of Cæsar has been more than once pointed out;
but the striking coincidence in the present instance has
never, I believe, before been noticed: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non animadvertebatis,</span>”
says Cæsar, likewise speaking of the exploits of
his Peninsular veterans, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">decem habere legiones populum
Romanum, quæ non solùm vobis obsistere, sed etiam
cœlum diruere possent.</span>” <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Bello Hispanico</cite>, § ult.
Even the number of veterans under the command of the
ancient and the modern General was nearly the same.</p>

<p>Indomitable energy and hearty courage are an old strain
in the English blood. They are thus attested by Cromwell:&mdash;“Indeed
we never find our men so cheerful as when
there is work to do.” Carlyle, <cite>Letters and Speeches of
Oliver Cromwell</cite>, Supplement. That no specific decoration
has yet been accorded to our Peninsular veterans
appears a most amazing oversight.</p>

<p>The courage displayed in our Peninsular sieges was of
the highest order. There can be no question that, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the commencement of the world, no military daring, no
dauntless valour, has been witnessed, Greek or Roman,
Saracenic or Chivalrous, to exceed&mdash;perhaps none to equal,
that of our storming parties at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz,
and San Sebastian. But it is very doubtful whether
human life was not unnecessarily squandered, and whether
the fire of the besieged should not have been silenced, and
their defences in the first instance destroyed. This opinion
seems now to be generally maintained both by engineer
officers and by experienced officers of the army. The dictum
of the great master of the art of fortification is in one respect
vindicated, though in another it has been broken down by
British heroism: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La précipitation dans les sièges ne hâte
point la prise des places, la retarde souvent, et ensanglante
toujours la scène.</span>” Vauban, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maximes</cite>. General Foy, who
sometimes emancipates himself from his prejudices against
England, and is often candid, while he praises the courage
of our men, says that it was needlessly expended, and that
the taking of fortified places by the rules of art is reduced
to a mathematical problem. But the bravery of our troops
is still unquestionable. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On eût dit que les ingénieurs
étaient là seulement pour construire les places d’armes
desquelles s’élanceraient les troupes destinées a l’assaut ou
à l’escalade; et encore eût-on pu à la rigueur, avec des
soldats si déterminés, se passer de leur ministère.</span>” Foy,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. ii. I must transcribe his testimony
as to the conduct of our officers: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’officier anglais conduisait
les troupes au feu sans effort, et avec une bravoure
admirable. * * La gloire de l’armée britannique lui vient
avant tout de son excellente discipline et de la bravoure calme
et franche de la nation.</span>” But Foy adds a stigma which
these sieges affixed to our army, and these sieges alone in
all our Peninsular campaigns, and the impartiality which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I am determined to preserve, and from which in some years
to come I am convinced not the slightest departure will
be tolerated, requires that it be rigorously unveiled for the
reprobation of a more enlightened age:&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une fois sortis
de la discipline, les soldats anglais se livrent à des excès
qui étonneraient les Cosaques; ils s’enivrent dès qu’ils le
peuvent, et leur ivresse est froide, apathique, anéantissante.</span>”
Humanity shudders at the brutalities perpetrated
by our soldiers at Badajoz and San Sebastian.</p>

<p>It was not without much reason that the general opinion
throughout Europe attributed the extraordinary successes
of the revolutionary armies of France to the admirable
arrangement of the light infantry service. Napoléon may
be said to have created the corps of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voltigeurs</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>,
upon which model were subsequently formed the Carabineers
and Rifles of the British service, and the Caçadores
of Spain and Portugal. The Prussian General Bulow in
1795, stated his opinion that “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’emploi de l’infanterie légère
est le dernier perfectionnement de la guerre, et qu’à la
rigueur on pourrait désormais se passer d’infanterie de ligne
dans les armées!</span>” <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit du Système de Guerre moderne,
par un ancien officier prussien.</cite> We may laugh at the
extravagant absurdity of the latter part of this statement,
but it shows the effect which Napoléon’s new system had
produced. An opinion nearly similar prevailed about the
same time in England. “The continent has been subdued
by the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, and battles are sought to be won
by killing one after another the officers of the enemy’s
army.” <cite>Letter to a General-Officer on the Establishment of
Rifle Corps in the British Army.</cite> By Col. Robinson. These
rifle corps were established, and became eminently successful,
being detached in companies to the different infantry
brigades. The coolness, however, of our ordinary infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
skirmishers in the Peninsula rendered an extensive introduction
of rifle corps unnecessary.</p>

<p>The rifle, as used in modern warfare, is the most terrible
because most treacherous of weapons. It would have fallen
especially under the ban of the Bayards and Montlucs of
the sixteenth century, who chivalrously deprecated the use
even of the common firelock, and formed vows worthy of <cite>Don
Quixote</cite>, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour qu’on abandonnât l’usage de ces armes
traîtresses au moyen desquelles un lâche, tapi derrière un
buisson, donne la mort au brave qu’il n’aurait pas regardé
en face!</span>”</p>

<p>Colonel H. A. Dillon says that for what the French call
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le moral d’une armée</i> he can find no equivalent in the English
language, and must explain his thought by paraphrase.
He defines this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moral</i> to be the liveliest courage produced
by the purest patriotism. <cite>Commentary on the Military
Establishments and Defences of the British Empire</cite>, vol. i.
This <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moral</i> the French lost by their repeated defeats in the
Peninsula, and by the conviction forced on them that even
the Pyrenees were no longer a barrier. Napoléon placed in
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le moral</i> three fourths of the power of an army. Celerity
of movement was the principal secret of the early French
successes, and of this the rapid marching of the French
soldier and his wonderful power of sustaining fatigue were
the main elements. The French soldier is small of stature,
as General Foy himself confesses, but he marches quick
and long, and this the General in great part attributes to
the French eating much more bread than any other European
troops: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les soldats qui mangent le plus de pain et le
moins de viande sont en général plus musculeux, et marchent
plus vite et plus long temps que les autres. * * Le Français
a besoin en campagne de deux livres de pain par jour.</span>”&mdash;Foy,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. i.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The astonishing developement which Napoléon gave to
the infantry service has been dwelt on by more than one
writer. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’infanterie française, cette nation des camps,</span>”
says De Barante, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Communes et de l’Aristocratie</cite>. Napoléon
gave to this arm a power and vigour to which it was
before a stranger. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Napoléon augmenta le bataillon d’infanterie
d’une autre compagnie d’élite, les voltigeurs. Ce
fut une idée heureuse que de rehausser dans l’estime publique
les hommes de petite taille, qui en général sont
les plus intelligens et les plus alertes.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
Guerre Pénins.</cite>) The consummation of the Emperor’s
gigantic views was found in the Imperial Guard. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
garde impériale représentait la gloire de l’armée et la
majesté de l’empire. On choisissait les officiers et les soldats
parmi ceux que les braves avaient signalés comme les plus
braves: tous étaient couverts de cicatrices.</span>”&mdash;(Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. i.) Napoléon after the battle of Marengo
called them his “granite column.” At the height
of his power his Imperial Guard consisted of 68 battalions,
31 squadrons, and 80 pieces of artillery&mdash;in itself a powerful
army. Never will the exclamation of these devoted men on
the field of Waterloo be forgotten: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La garde meurt et ne
se rend pas!</i>”</p>

<p>The peculiar constitution of the French grenadier corps
is likewise to be remarked. These bodies were the combined
excerpts of all the best men from every regiment.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’éclat et la prééminence des grenadiers Français * * l’usage
de réunir tous ceux d’une ou de plusieurs brigades pour tenter
des actions de vigueur.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite>, liv. ii.)
To these we never opposed more than our average regimental
forces, and their picked men were for the most part
overcome by our rank and file. What this rank and file
was composed of let the following passage attest. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Anglais n’escaladent pas la montagne et n’effleurent pas la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
plaine, lestes et rapides comme les Français; mais ils sont
plus silencieux, plus calmes, plus obéissants; pour ce
motif leurs feux sont plus assurés et plus meurtriers.</span>” (Foy,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite>, liv. ii.) Such is the brilliant testimony
to the merits of the British soldier by one of
Napoléon’s own Generals. Our footmen are still the
sturdy yeomen who accomplished such marvels at Crecy.
If in a state little removed from brute ignorance they have
done such wonders, what may be expected from them in
the not far distant day, when they shall become elevated
by education to a more fitting standard? Splendid as our
horses are, and our dragoons both heavy and light, the
strength of our army will be always in its powerful infantry,
in their steady fire, indomitable endurance, and incomparable
use of the bayonet. These are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">robur peditum</i>,
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triarii</i> of the Roman legions, who were chosen
from the strongest men, and ever fought on foot. It was
remarked that in moments of peril they set their limbs so
strongly, that their knees were somewhat bowed (precisely
like our modern pugilists), as if they would rather die than
remove from their places; and it passed into a proverb, when
a thing came to extremity: “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad triarios res venit</i>.”</p>

<p>The use of tents, like many another classic incumbrance,
has been swept away from campaigning by our modern
tactics, which originated at the commencement of the
Peninsular War, and, arrived at the bivouac, the “lodging
is on the cold ground” and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub Jove frigido</i>. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’usage
des tentes préservait les troupes des maladies pernicieuses.
Tout cela est vrai, et cependant on ne reviendra ni aux
petites armées, ni aux sièges de convention ni aux maisons
de toile.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. i.) The commander
who makes a campaign with tents is fettered with
embarrassments as to means of transport, which must
always place him in a state of inferiority to an adversary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
not thus encumbered. This is one of the great changes
wrought by the wonderful genius of Napoléon, which even
amidst the new hardships which he imposed, secured
almost the adoration of his soldiers. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils frémissent
encore d’alégresse en exprimant le transport dont on fut
saisi, quand l’empereur, qu’on croyait bien loin, apparut
tout-à-coup devant le front des grenadiers, monté sur son
cheval blanc et suivi de son mamelouck.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
Guerre Pénins.</cite> liv. ii.) At the close of the War, the person
of Wellington commanded almost equal admiration.</p>

<p>I am a great admirer of General Napier, whom I regard
as the counterpart of Thucydides, the soldier-historian of
Athens, and to whom may be not infelicitously applied the
character assigned to Xenophon (another <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Athenian narrater'">Athenian narrator</ins>
of military exploits in which he himself participated) by
our earliest Latin lexicographer, Thomas Thomas, the contemporary
of Shakspeare: “Xenophon was a noble and
wyse captaine, and of a delectable style in wrytynge.”
Napier’s style is enchanting and stirs like the sound of a
trumpet. My obligations to him are unbounded. But
Heaven forbid that his enthusiasm for War should become
general, for it is of a truly rabid character:&mdash;“War is
the condition of this world. From man to the smallest
insect all are at strife!” (<cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite>, book
xxiv. chap. 6.) This is a mere reproduction of Hobbes:
“The state of nature is a state of war.” I trust that
peace will ere long be the enduring condition of this world;
and there are happily indications of that approaching consummation.
If I sing the glories of the Peninsular War,
it is because it was of a defensive character and we struck
for Freedom. We may surely now repose on our laurels
(as it is phrased), and never hereafter engage in a war
which shall not be in the strictest sense inevitable.</p>

<p>I am happy to record upon this subject the enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sentiments of a French General: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’esprit de liberté
tuera l’esprit militaire. Il ne sera plus permis aux princes
de faire entr’égorger les peuples pour des intérêts de dynastie,
ou pour des lubies d’ambition. Les gouvernants, quels que
soient leur titre et l’origine de leur pouvoir, ne pourront
subsister qu’en s’effaçant personnellement devant la
volonté générale. Les nations, comparant les désastres de la
bataille au mince profit de la victoire, ne pousseront plus le
cri de guerre, hormis dans les circonstances très rares où il
s’agira de vivre libre ou mourir.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre
Pénins.</cite> liv. i.) Elsewhere he makes this acute criticism on
the audacious designs of Napoléon. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le despotisme avait
été organisé pour faire la guerre; on continua la guerre
pour conserver le despotisme. Le sort en était jeté; la
France devait conquérir l’Europe, ou l’Europe subjuguer
la France. * * La nature a marqué un terme au-delà
duquel les enterprises folles ne peuvent pas être conduites
avec sagesse. Ce terme l’empereur l’atteignit en Espagne,
et le dépassa en Russie. S’il eût échappé alors à sa
ruine, son inflexible outrecuidance (presumption) lui eût
fait trouver ailleurs Baylen et Moscou.</span>” Such is the impartial
testimony of one of his own generals.</p>

<p>The French “playing at soldiers” is an old vice, older than
the days of Sir Thomas More, who thus pleasantly hits it off:
“In France there is yet a more pestiferous sort of people,
for the whole country is full of soldiers, that are still kept
up in time of peace, if such a state of a nation can be
called a peace: and these are kept in pay upon the same
account, it being a maxim of those pretended statesmen,
that it is necessary for the public safety, to have a good
body of veteran soldiers ever in readiness. But France has
learned to its cost, how dangerous it is to feed such beasts.”
Louis XIV. kept up a standing army of 440,000 men, and
Napoléon had frequently more.</p>

<p>The Gauls in modern times seem to have very much
changed their nature, for so far from invading other
countries, their reputation amongst the ancients was for
remaining to fight at home, according to the obvious
interpretation of a line in Pindar:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse"><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνδομάχας ἅτ’ ἀλέκτωρ.</span>&mdash;<cite>Olymp.</cite> xii.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">domi pugnans ceu Gallus.</span>” To be sure, it is just
possible that the learned Theban may have meant that
humble domestic fowl, a cock. Erasmus reads “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">domi
abditus.</span>” There can be no doubt that a cock was meant,
and unquestionably it is a bellicose bird. The passage
from Pindar might be fairly rendered by the Latin adage:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallus in suo sterquilinio,</span>” which it is needless to turn
into the vernacular. There are symptoms of the French
reforming this national vice, and I therefore shall not
dwell upon a somewhat disagreeable subject.</p>

<p>I am happy to be the first to record the true orthography
of one of our two first and not least important battles in the
Peninsula, Roriça and Vimieiro. They used to be invariably
written Roleia and “Vimeira.” Napier has considerably
improved upon this, making the latter “Vimiero.” But
still he is wrong. The correct word is “Vimieiro.” Even
had I made no other discovery, my four years’ residence in
Portugal would not have been useless. True, it may be
said that the General has only “knocked an <em>i</em> out of it” in
military fashion. But, though the error be confined to a
single letter, it would be only the change of a letter to call
Waterloo “Waterlog,” and who could excuse such a
travesty of our glorious victory? These mistakes in the
orthography of the names of Peninsular localities are
common to all English writers, and excellent a scholar
as Southey was, they disfigure his History as well as that
of Napier. I find the names of these two battles misdescribed
as “Roleia” and “Vimieira” in the memoir by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Sir B. D’Urban lately reproduced at the elevation of Sir
H. Hardinge to the Peerage&mdash;should I not rather say the
elevation of the Peerage by the accession to it of that
gallant and chivalrous Peninsular veteran?</p>

<p>The French, too, write the names of these battles
as erroneously. They call them uniformly “Roliça” and
“Vimeiro,” vide “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Guerre de la Péninsule, par
le Général Foy</cite>,” “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires par Pellot, Campagnes par De
la Pène</cite>,” <em>and</em> “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires de M. la Duchesse d’Abrantès</cite>”
passim. Napier in the twenty-fourth book of his History
takes leave of the comparative approach to accuracy in his
earlier books, and speaks of these battles every where as
“Roliça” and “Vimiera.” Specks in the sun!</p>

<p>In my choice of a metre I have been led by the following
considerations. The beauty and completeness of
the stanza of Spenser appear now to be generally acknowledged.
But it certainly presents great difficulties in a
language so unvocal compared with those of Southern
Europe, and so little abounding in rhymes as the English.
It is more difficult in a narrative and consecutive poem
than in one of a descriptive and reflective character, like
<cite>Childe Harold</cite>, where the topics and the order in which
they shall be discussed are both at the discretion of the
poet. Yet the terrible exigencies of four recurring rhymes
in each stanza have led even such a master as Byron into
not a few puzzling dilemmas, as in his description of Cintra
(<cite>Childe Harold</cite>, i. 19), where he has completed a stanza, in
which “steep,” “weep,” and “deep” had already done
service, with “torrents leap,” although the faintest trickle
of a torrent was never seen in that locality! As he proceeded
in his task, he attained to a more perfect mastery
of his materials; and, I think, the fourth canto unsurpassed
in English poetry. It may be asked why I hoped
to succeed in what Byron found so difficult? My answer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that I do not think the difficulty insuperable, as Byron has
proved it not to be in the latter and infinitely finer part of
his poem, that none but a Milton could elevate blank verse
to the sublimity as well as harmony of the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,
that rhyme, and especially such an elegant form of rhymed
verse as the stanza of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, possesses a popular
and inalienable charm, that success (if achieved at all) rises
with the magnitude of the difficulties encountered, and
that Spenser himself, Thomson’s <cite>Castle of Indolence</cite>,
his other imitators, Shenstone’s <cite>Schoolmistress</cite>, Beattie’s
<cite>Minstrel</cite> and West’s <cite>Education</cite>, Campbell’s <cite>Gertrude of
Wyoming</cite>, occasional short pieces by Wordsworth, Wiffin’s
<cite>Translation of Tasso</cite>, Scott’s introductions to very many
cantos of his several poems (in these two latter cases I
speak merely of mechanical execution), Shelley’s <cite>Revolt of
Islam</cite> and <cite>Adonais</cite>, Kirke White’s <cite>Hermit of the Pacific</cite>
and <cite>Christiad</cite>, Mrs. Norton’s <cite>Child of the Islands</cite>, and a few
(too few) verses of Tennyson and Milnes abundantly prove the
capability of the stanza. The Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i>, although
sanctified by the use of Tasso and Ariosto, adopted almost
universally in the heroic poetry of one Peninsula, and most
successfully introduced by Camóens into the only epic
poetry of the other, appears unadapted for any but burlesque
or satirical poetry in the English language, the serious passages
of <cite>Don Juan</cite> deriving all their beauty from being
interspersed with lighter, and the excellence and power of
Fairfax’s <cite>Tasso</cite> being marred by the effect of the metre.
The English heroic couplet becomes clearly, I think, monotonous
in a long poem&mdash;a doom from which not all the
genius of Dryden and Pope could rescue it. And if in his
<cite>Corsair</cite>, <cite>Lara</cite>, and <cite>The Island</cite>, Byron proved, in the words
of Jeffrey, that “the oldest and most respectable measure
that is known amongst us is as flexible as any other,” and
elicited from Sir E. Brydges a just tribute to his “unbroken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
stream of native eloquence,” it is precisely because “the
narrative (as he says) is rapid,” and because the hazardous
experiment is not tried of continuing rhymed distiches
through a long poem. The Italian <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i> has been
observed to derive great strength from its majestic close,
which is invariably in a doubly rhymed couplet, and I have
occasionally introduced double rhymes in this and other
parts of the stanza to relieve the tendency to monotony.
The most distinguished cultivator of Southern literature
that England has ever produced, Lord Holland, in his
translations from Lope de Vega, Luis de Gonzaga, &amp;c.,
and from Ariosto, was very successful in this imitation.
The hypercatalectic syllable occurs in every line of Tasso’s
<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gerusalemme</cite>, and in every line of Camóens’ <cite lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Lusiadas</cite>, and
the Italians and Portuguese therefore call the verse “hendecasyllabic.”
A poem of any length constructed on this
principle in English would degenerate into pure burlesque;
but Byron and others have proved that it may be advantageously
introduced as a pleasing variety.</p>

<p>The Alexandrine at the close of each stanza of Spenser
produces an equivalent, and perhaps even a more majestic
effect. It has been objected to this Alexandrine that it
gives a drawling tone to a long narrative poem; but I do
not think with justice, since very much depends on the
mode in which the line is constructed. Pope’s celebrated
“needless Alexandrine” has created a prejudice against
this metre, which I admit to be just where it is interspersed
with heroic verse, since, as Johnson correctly observes, it
disappoints the ear. But in the stanza of Spenser it is
expected. How easily the form and character of a verse
may be changed by transposing a word or two will appear
from Pope’s famous imitative Alexandrine:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Which like a wounded snake drags its slow length along.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Alter two monosyllables, and it goes quite trippingly from
the tongue:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“And like a wounded snake it drags its length along.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">There is no essential alteration. The adjective “slow”
omitted is an incorrect epithet applied to “length,” since
the quickest objects in nature, a racehorse or a greyhound,
appear very long when upon full stretch, and in most rapid
movement. The trick of the line is in the simple use of
spondees in the place of iambuses, “which like,” “drags
its,” “slow length.” How short and compact an Alexandrine
may be, may be seen in Horace’s Epodes <em>passim</em>.
Take the first line of the celebrated second ode, the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longè
pulcherrima</i>” by the consent of all critics:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<p class="verse">“Beatus ille qui procul negotiis.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">This is a perfect Alexandrine, and though consisting of
twelve syllables, does not appear longer than one of Scott’s
shortest octosyllabic lines in the <cite>Lady of the Lake</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“Thy threats, thy mercy I defy.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The reason is because it is a pure Iambic line, and therefore
very vocal; since, if it contained many consonants, as
nearly every English line does, they must make most of the
previous vowels long by position; and, though accent
generally determines the quantity in English, literal quantity
enters more into the construction of English verse
than is commonly supposed.</p>

<p>I may here observe that the stanza commonly called
“Spenserian” is by no means so purely an original invention
of that most imaginative poet as is usually represented.
The Alexandrine at the close is the only part that is original.
I find the germ of Spenser’s stanza very palpably in the
old ballet-staves and in the works of two poets who lived
fully a century before him, Skelton who styled himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Poet Laureate to Henry VII. and Stephen Hawes who was
Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the same monarch. The
following stanza is from Skelton’s “Elegy on the death of
Henry Percy, fourth Earl of Northumberland:”&mdash;it is the
ballet-stave of seven, in which was written an enormous
quantity of early, but now forgotten, English poetry, and
in which Spenser has written his “Ruins of Time,” and
Shakspeare his “Rape of Lucrece.”</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">O cruell Mars, thou dedly god of war!</p>
<p class="verse2">O dolorous Teusday, dedicate to thy name,</p>
<p class="verse">When thou shoke thy sworde so noble a man to mar!</p>
<p class="verse2">O grounde ungracious, unhappy be thy fame,</p>

<p class="verse">Most noble earl! O fowle mysuryd grounde</p>
<p class="verse">Whereon he gat his fynal dedely wounde!</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Down to the end of the fifth line this is precisely the stanza
of Spenser. With the addition of two lines, one rhyming
with the last, and the other with the fifth, and of two syllables
to the closing line, it is literally that stanza. But in
fact the latter addition was often made by both Skelton
and Hawes, though irregularly, metrical cadence being then
imperfectly understood, and both poets being of the “tumbling”
school. This poem was probably composed in the
year 1490. Skelton died in 1529, and an edition of his
poems in black letter appeared in 1568. I take the stanza
which follows from a poem of Hawes’s called “The History
of Graunde Amoure and la Belle Pucel,” written in
1505 and published in quarto in 1555:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">Till that I came unto a ryall gate,</p>
<p class="verse2">Where I saw stondynge the goodly portresse,</p>
<p class="verse">Whyche asked me from whence I came a-late;</p>
<p class="verse2">To whom I gan in every thynge expresse</p>
<p class="verse2">All myne adventure, chaunce, and busynesse,</p>
<p class="verse">And eke my name; I told her every dell;</p>
<p class="verse">Whan she herde this she lyked me right well.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The construction of this stanza is the same as of the former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but the versification is rather rougher. It, like the
other, is very near the Spenserian stanza. But it is not the
Spenserian stanza. Friar Bacon and Leonardo da Vinci
were very near the discovery of steam, but they did not
discover steam, or at all events they did not apply it. The
stanzas cited, however, contain the great distinguishing
peculiarity of the stanza of Spenser, which is the reduplication
of the rhyme, that closes the second and fourth
lines, in the fifth&mdash;the doubling of the stanza within itself,
and turning upon this most musical pivot. And this
beauty, like so many other great discoveries, I believe to
be probably the result of accident. Add another line to
each of the foregoing stanzas, make it rhyme with the first
and third, and interpose it between the fourth and fifth
lines, and you have the exact <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i> of the Italians.
This ballet-stave is the clear germ of the Spenserian stanza,
which with a few <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">perfectionnemens</i> is precisely as it stands.
It may be traced more directly to the ballet-stave of eight,
but either will suit equally well for illustration.</p>

<p>To make this quite intelligible to every reader, Hawes’s
stanza becomes the exact <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i> of the Italians, which
Surrey brought into England, and in which Spenser wrote
two of his poems, the rhyme of Fairfax’s <cite>Tasso</cite>, of Frere’s
<cite>Whistlecraft</cite>, and Byron’s <cite>Don Juan</cite>, by the insertion of the
single line which I have added here in italics:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Till that I came unto a royal gate,</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The stanza becomes purely Spenserian by the addition of
the two lines and one word which I here insert in italics:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2">Till that I came unto a royal gate,</p>

<p class="verse2">And eke my name; I told her every dell:</p>
<p class="verse">When she this <em>story</em> heard she likéd me right well.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The ballet-stave of seven is one of the many varieties of
Chaucer, who has written in this measure four of his
“Canterbury Tales,” and composed a very long poem in it,
<cite>Troylus</cite>, of which the following stanza is a specimen (lib.
ii. 1030.)</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">For though that the best harper upon live</p>

<p class="noindent">This, like the other, becomes the perfect <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i> by
the addition of a single line, which I have likewise marked
in italics:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">For though that the best harper upon live</p>
<p class="verse">Would on the beste sounid jolly harpe</p>

<p class="noindent">The addition refers to a celebrated ancient Welsh harper
mentioned with honour by Chaucer himself in his <cite>Boke of
Fame</cite>. I shall not further meddle by patchwork with the
illustrious Father of English Poetry. But, as in the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
case, by the addition of two lines and one word I could
at once convert his stanza into that of Spenser. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava
rima</i> was not then invented, nor for many years after
Chaucer wrote, not having made its appearance until the
days of Boiardo and Berni, nor been brought to perfection
until the lyre was held by the master hands of Ariosto and
Tasso. The secret of the great resemblance of this stanza
as employed by Chaucer to that subsequently invented by
his Italian successors is, that both delved in the same mine
and wrought upon the same material&mdash;the Sicilian sonnet,
first introduced and naturalized in Europe by Chaucer’s
great contemporary, Petrarch. So perfect was this instrument,
the sonnet, at its discovery, that the fine taste
of Petrarch adhered to it throughout life with marvellous
tenacity, and at this day Wordsworth has without change
written nearly half his poetry in it. I believe Chaucer,
who either copied or adapted many of his modes of versification
from Petrarch, to have moulded his ballet-staves
both of seven and eight, by squaring them with the first
half of the Sicilian or Petrarcan sonnet, with which they
are nearly identical. The Italian successors of Petrarch
in the same way took the first half of the sonnet, transposing
the first and second lines, and inserting another line
between the fourth and fifth lines. Thus simply is derived
the far-famed <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i>.</p>

<p>In real fact and truth, Chaucer has had nearly as
much share in the formation of what is known as the
stanza of Spenser as Spenser himself. That stanza is
purely the ballet-stave of eight with three close rhymes&mdash;with
the simple addition by Spenser of an Alexandrine
at the close, rhyming with the last verse of the ballet-stave.
There are some who trace these ballet-staves to
the Latin rhymed church iambics, and the germ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ballet-stave of eight has been sought in a Latin hymn
written by the German monk, Ernfrid, in the ninth
century; but they are to be traced more probably (at least
in their more perfect shape) to the Romance poetry of the
Provençals. The first instance I meet with of the use
of the ballet-stave of eight in English verse is in the elegy
on the death of our first Edward, written from internal
evidence shortly after that period. The rhymes and their
arrangement are precisely as in the stanza of Spenser, but
the verse is octosyllabic:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">Alle that beoth of huerte trewe</p>
<p class="verse2">A stounde herkneth to my song</p>
<p class="verse">Of duel that deth hath diht us newe</p>
<p class="verse2">That maketh me syke and sorrow among. &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Chaucer was the first who wrote this stanza in the heroic
line of ten syllables, and his contribution to the stanza is
therefore quite as important as Spenser’s addition of the
closing Alexandrine. In this stanza Chaucer has written
the whole of the Monk’s Tale, and how entirely it is the
stanza of <cite>Childe Harold</cite>, with the exception of the Alexandrine
at the end, may be seen from the following
example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
<p class="verse">His wif his lordes, and his concubines</p>
<p class="verse">Ay dronken, while her appetitis last,</p>
<p class="verse">Out of thise noble vessels sondry wines;</p>
<p class="verse">And on a wall this King his eyen cast,</p>
<p class="verse">And saw an hand armles that wrote ful fast,</p>
<p class="verse">For fere of whiche he quoke, and siked sore.</p>
<p class="verse">This hand that Balthasar so sore aghast,</p>
<p class="verse">Wrote <em>Mane techel phares</em> and no more.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The <cite>Faëry Queen</cite> stanza must be regarded as a felicitous
discovery rather than invention, and even the merit of the
addition becomes diminished by the consideration that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Alexandrine verse had become a great favourite amongst
his contemporary poets before he used it. It was the
favourite metre of a Howard and a Sidney at the commencement
of the era of Elizabeth, and is frequently met
in our alliterative poems, both early English and Anglo-Saxon.
Yet Dr. Johnson has most erroneously represented
Spenser as the inventor of the Alexandrine! But so
fortunate was Spenser’s completion of the stanza, that all
the attempts of Phineas Fletcher, Giles Fletcher, Prior,
and even Milton, to improve on it were unavailing, and
it may now be regarded as one of the special glories of
England.</p>

<p>The stanza of Spenser, as used by that poet, was by no
means the perfect musical stave that it is at present,
so exquisitely attuned with the dominant quadruple rhyme
for its key-note. Thomson appears to me to have brought
it very nearly to perfection&mdash;his sole drawback being a
too frequent indulgence in imperfect rhymes. In Byron’s
fourth canto of <cite>Childe Harold</cite> I conceive it to be brought
to perfection. Spenser indulges constantly in imperfect
rhymes, and though sometimes musical as well as often
charmingly fanciful and suggestive, he was by no means
such a master of language and rhythm as Shakspeare, whose
influence, followed up by the examples of Milton, Dryden,
and Pope, is felt in the excellence of the poetical diction
of the poets of this century. Though Spenser in some degree
discovered the stanza which bears his name, he did not complete
the discovery, for his Alexandrine is commonly deficient
in the cæsural pause, which is absolutely essential to the
satisfaction of the ear and to the majestic close of the
stanza, and now almost as much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de rigueur</i> as it is in the
French Alexandrine, which is the common heroic measure
of our neighbours. The Alexandrine in every second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stanza of Spenser is without it, and the effect is very bad,
as may be seen from the following examples:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad1 fs85" lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">
“So shall wrath, jealousy, grief, love, die and decay.”<br />
“You shame-faced are but Shame-facedness itself is she.”<br />
“Save an old nymph, hight Panope, to keep it clean.”<br />
“Of turtle doves, she sitting in an ivory chaire.”<br />
“And so had left them languishing ’twixt hope and feare.”<br />
“Excludes from faire hope withouten further triall.”<br />

<p>Admitting the richness and fertility of Spenser’s fancy,
I cannot find that he has depth, originality, or brilliancy
of thought to compensate for a roughness, which is
amazing by the side of Shakspeare’s exquisite versification,
or to justify the high opinion expressed by Wordsworth.
Compare Spenser’s Description of Lucifer’s Palace,
commencing</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">“A stately palace built of squared brick,</p>
<p class="verse">“Which cunningly was without mortar laid”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">with Milton’s Pandemonium!</p>

<p>Superadded to Spenser’s roughness, which the antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
style affected by him in some degree palliates, are very
frequent imperfect rhymes and slovenly repetitions of the
same identical metrical sounds, as <em>plain</em>, <em>plane</em>, and <em>complain</em>,
<em>see</em> and <em>sea</em>, rhyming in the same stanza&mdash;liberties
which now are utterly inadmissible. It is very true
that the recurrence of four lines which rhyme together
and of three lines which likewise rhyme with each other in
each stanza makes the Spenserian stanza in a long poem
extraordinarily difficult, without an occasional manifestation
of these defects; but the exigencies of modern criticism,
I think justly, require that the difficulty be overcome.
And a portion, doubtless, of the superiority of modern
English to modern French and Italian poetry arises from
explosion of imperfect rhymes. If the poets of these
days are degenerate in grasp of thought, they are at least
superior to their predecessors and to their continental
contemporaries in the mechanism of their art.</p>

<p>Having said thus much of the stanza which I have
chosen, I shall add that, rejecting classical conformity
in all those matters wherein I conceive the advanced spirit
of the age to demand modern treatment, I have availed
myself largely of classical allusion, and to a certain extent
of classical imagery, to impart interest to a subject which
might otherwise smell too much of “villanous saltpetre,”
and have in some cases adhered more closely to true
classical nomenclature than has hitherto been the custom.
I regard it as one of the advantages of the acuteness of
modern scholarship to have cleared away much rubbish
and removed many an excrescence. But the Grecian may
unhappily descend into the Græculist, and by adopting
too much spoil every thing. Thus I conceive no good
effect to be produced by writing the name Pisistratus in
a serious work “Peisistratus,” and I would not imitate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
modern poetry Homer’s not at all ignobly meant comparison
of Aias (Ajax) to an ass any more than I would adopt the
word <em>hog</em> as applied to Achilles: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅγ’ ὣς εἰπὼν</span> “he thus
speaking”&mdash;“<em>Hog</em> thus speaking” would be rather offensive
to English ears. Neither would I write “Klutaimnestra”
for Clytemnestra, “Loukas” for Luke, “Dabid” for
David, or “Eua” for our first mother. In matters of taste,
like these, above all things we must observe the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus in
rebus</i>. Quintilian, a master in all that relates to elegance
of speech, explains very well that such things must be regulated
by feeling. Speaking of the beauty of one of the
smallest of particles in a passage of Cicero, he says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cur
<em>hosce</em> potiùs quàm <em>hos</em>? Rationem fortassè non reddam;
sentiam esse melius,</span>” <cite>Instit.</cite> ix. 4. “Aias” I would at
once reclaim from the vulgar tyranny of “Ajax,” which, as
we pronounce it, scarcely differs from <em>a jakes</em>. This pronunciation,
be it observed, is purely British and German, for
it is nearly certain that the Latins pronounced the word
which they spelt <em>Ajax</em> quite like the Greek <em>Aias</em>, <em>Ajax</em>
being pronounced <em>Aias</em> in nearly all the languages of
Southern Europe at this day. In this poem, accordingly,
I spell the name “Aias.” In the same way I restore the
ancient and true spelling of the name “Leonides.” (Herod.
lib. vii. <em>passim.</em> Thucyd. i, 132.) Achilles I would retain
because more musical than “Achilleus;” but I would
expunge the word “Hectoring” from our language, as
originating in disgraceful ignorance, because so far from
being a bully, Hector was a hero of the noblest and most
amiable character, and is so described by Homer. Helen
thus apostrophizes his dead body:</p>

<p>“Hector, to my soul far dearest of all my brothers-in-law!

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hector</span>&mdash;a bully, a blustering, turbulent, noisy
fellow!!”</p>

<p>I have adopted the Homeric names in preference to
the common Latin forms, as Aphrodité instead of Venus,
Atrides for Menelaüs (where so substituted in the original)
for the same reasons which have influenced Archdeacon
Williams in the spirited prose translations which accompany
his learned Essay, “<cite>Homerus</cite>,” Mr. Guest of Caius
College, Cambridge, in the specimen of translation of the
first book of Homer into hexameters which is introduced
into his ingenious <cite>History of English Rhythms</cite>, the
Translator of Homer in the late numbers of <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite>, and the learned Voss in his hexametrical German
version. I have chosen the name Paris, however,
in place of Alexander, for the sake of clearness and appropriateness
in the allusion, and to avoid confusion with the
better-known hero of that name. I do not know that it
is necessary to extend my poetical confessions on this
subject further. But I shall just add that in pronunciation
I have adhered to classical quantity, wherever it could
be done without a sacrifice of beauty, but have unhesitatingly
departed from it in such cases as that of the word
“Hyperion,” in which Shakspeare has fixed the accent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the antepenultimate, with so fine an effect in the way
of improvement on the (to merely English ears) intolerable
“Hyperíon” which is of classical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rigueur</i>, as to have
induced the otherwise uncompromising Cooke, translator of
Hesiod, to follow his too sweetly sinning example. I hope
I shall not be exorcised for thus erring with Shakspeare.</p>

<p>The best image that I can offer of the Græculist carver
of cherry-stones is such a realization of Buridan’s ass suspended
between two rival and opposite bundles of hay, as
might be presented by a bad concocter of College exercises,
puzzled in an address to Prometheus to choose between the
heptasyllabic form “Iapetionides” and the tetrasyllabic
“Japetides,” to commence his puling hexameter!</p>

<p>The earliest military expedition into Spain, of which
there is mention amongst ancient poets or doubt amongst
historians, is that of Hercules, amongst whose twelve
labours is recorded his victory over Geryon and obtaining
possession of his crown. Geryon, the son of Crysaör, was
King of the Balearic Isles, and hence by poetical fiction he
was endowed with three bodies, and is commonly called
<em>tricorpor</em>, <em>triplex</em>, or <em>tergeminus</em>, and sometimes <cite>Pastor
Iberus</cite>. Virgil describes Hercules proceeding to the
conquest of Cacus from that of Geryon thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse10" lang="la" xml:lang="la">&mdash;&mdash;Nam maximus ultor,</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tergemini nece Geryonis spoliisque superbus,</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alcides aderat, taurosque huc victor agebat</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingentes: vallemque boves amnemque tenebant.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Æn.</cite> viii. 201.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Of these Cacus stole four of the finest, and though he
ingeniously dragged them by the tails, was the cause of
his own destruction. And that was not the first time
that meddling with Spanish affairs was fatal to a foreign
robber! Horace likewise alludes to this expedition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Hercules, in compliment to Augustus (<cite>Carm.</cite> iii. 14),
where he compares the victorious return of the Roman
from Iberia to that of Hercules&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Herculis ritu.</span>” The
first authenticated occupation of the country was by the
Phœnicians, who colonized it extensively, but according to
their usual practice endeavoured long to keep their discovery
secret. The name of the country “<em>Span</em>” in the
Phœnician signifies “a mystery.” The rivalry between
Rome and Carthage brought the Romans subsequently
to the Peninsula, and Spain since that period has played a
great part in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The warlike character of the ancient Spaniards is attested
by a variety of circumstances; by the terrific struggle
which they maintained against the overwhelming power of
Rome, by their determined and unflinching resistance to
Hannibal as well as Scipio, by such desperately sustained
sieges as those of Saguntum and Numantia, by the complimentary
allusions to their valour with which the Latin
poets abound, and not least by the reputation of their ancient
armour, which was in the highest esteem at Rome in the
days of Julius and Augustus Cæsar. Thus, when Horace
addresses Iccius on his change of the study of Philosophy
for a military life, he twits him with having promised
better things than to exchange his splendid library for
Iberian cuirasses:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cùm tu coëmptos undique nobiles</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libros Panæti, Socraticam et domum</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutare loricis Iberis,</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pollicitus meliora, tendis?</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Carm.</cite> i. 29.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The metallurgic fame of Spain covers a period of
nearly two score centuries. It is attested by Hudibras
and Horace, by Le Sage and Pliny:&mdash;“Iron ores are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
almost everywhere found ... there is a variety of different
species ... and great difference in the forges. But the
greatest difference of all is the water, into which it is
plunged when red-hot. This glory of her iron has ennobled
certain places, as Bilbilis in Spain,” <em>lib.</em> xxxiv. <em>cap.</em>
14. Pliny here alludes to the town now known as Bilbao,
which retained its reputation for sword-blades, like Toledo,
down to a recent period. He speaks of it as a city in Tarracon
or Cantabria, corresponding with the Basque Provinces
of which Bilbao is one of the chief towns. How strange
that, after the lapse of seventeen centuries, representatives
from this very Bilbao should have accompanied the Asturian
Deputies to England to solicit a subsidy of arms from the
descendants of those who were such utter barbarians, when
the cuirasses of Cantabria were eagerly sought after by the
nobles of Imperial Rome!</p>

<p>The Greeks called Italy “Hesperia,” because it was
situated to the west of them, and the Romans called Spain
“Hesperia” equally, because it was to the west of Italy.
But the Latin poets, imitating the Greeks, very frequently
call Italy “Hesperia” also. Thus Virgil:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est locus, Hesperiam Graii cognomine dicunt.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Æn.</cite> i. 534.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Macrobius prefers deriving the origin of the name, as applied
to Italy, from its western situation, to the fact of its being
chosen by Hesperus for his residence, when he was expelled
by his brother Atlas: “Italy is called Hesperia, because
it lies to the west.” (Macrob. <cite>Saturn.</cite> lib. i. cap. 3.)</p>

<p>Horace, when he applies the name to Spain, distinguishes
the latter country by the addition of the word “ultima,”
thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse2" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui nunc Hesperiâ sospes ab ultimâ</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caris multa sodalibus, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Carm.</cite> i. 36.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Strabo, lib. i. seems to derive the name from situation,
where he describes the Spaniards as the most western
nation, “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάλιστα ἑσπέριοι.</span>” And both he and Pliny state
that Hispania was likewise called Iberia, either from a king
of that name or from the river Iberus (Ebro).</p>

<p>Iberia, though the name by which, after Hispania,
Spain was most commonly known to the Latins was, by a
confusion not very complimentary to their geographical
accuracy, likewise the name of a region in Asia Minor.
It was a tract in Pontus separated from Colchis by the
Moschic mountains, and corresponds with the modern
Georgia:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Herbasque, quas Iolcos atque Iberia</p>
<p class="verse2" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mittit venenorum ferax.</p>
<p class="verse16">Horat. <cite>Epod.</cite> 5.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The names “Hesperia” and “Iberia” are found together
in the same stanza of Camóens as applied to the Peninsula,
yet with some vague attempt to confine the latter name to
the Spanish portion exclusively:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">“Nome em armas ditoso, em noss’ Hesperia,</p>
<p class="verse4" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">*<span class="pad2">*</span><span class="pad2">*</span><span class="pad2">*</span><span class="pad2">*</span></p>
<p class="verse" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Se não quizera ir ver a terra Iberia.”</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Lus.</cite> iv. 54.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Both names are properly applicable to the entire Peninsula,
including Spain and Portugal, the second epithet, modified
by the prefix <em>Celto</em> into “Celtiberia,” being the ancient
name of Aragon and Catalonia, and Iliberia that of
Granada. The name Iberia as applied to Spain is found
in Virgil, <cite>Æn.</cite> ix. 582:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pictus acu chlamydem, et ferrugine clarus Iberâ,</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">and under this name the country is described elaborately by
Avienus (P. C. 380).</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamque suis opibus cumulavit Iberia dives, &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Ausonius (also P. C. 380) makes use of both the names
“Hispania” and “Iberia:”</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">His Hispanus ager tellus ubi dives Iberum.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Juvenal (P. C. 120) uses the name “Hispania” as the
distinctive appellation of the country, which became better
and more perilously known in his time than in the days
of Horace and Virgil:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Horrida vitanda est Hispania.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Sat.</cite> viii. 116.</p>

<p>There is classical authority for a happy variety of names
in describing Spain&mdash;“Hesperia,” “Iberia,” “Hispania:”</p>

<p class="noindent">Spain was anciently divided into Hispania <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulterior</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Citerior</i>. The former comprehended Bætica, the present
Andalucía, and Lusitania nearly corresponding to what is
now called Portugal. Hispania Citerior comprised all the
rest of the Peninsula. The name “Hesperia” was more
commonly applied by the ancient poets to the Italian
Peninsula than to the Spanish. Thus Virgil (in addition
to the passage above cited):</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et sæpe Hesperiam, sæpe Itala regna vocare. * *</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed quis ad Hesperiæ venturos littora Teucros</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crederet?</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Æn.</cite> iii. 185.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The preponderance of authority is clearly in favour of
designating Spain as “Iberia” or “Hispania,” and generally
confining “Hesperia” to Italy. Ovid has a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
charming nymph named Hesperie, no connection, however,
of the Hesperides, of whom the most famous was that
Arethusa whose fountain-streamlet is so celebrated, and
whose enchanting name has been tastefully introduced into
the nomenclature of the British Navy. Ovid’s Hesperie,
the daughter of Cebrenis, was loved and persecuted by the
Trojan hero Æsacos, whose discovery of her is thus exquisitely
described:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aspicit Hesperien patriâ Cebrenida ripâ,</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Injectos humeris siccantem sole capillos.</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Visa fugit Nymphe!</p>
<p class="verse16">Ov. <cite>Met.</cite> xi. 769.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">A very amusing and somewhat malicious mistake was
recently witnessed at one of our English Universities. A
prize was offered for a composition on “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hesperiæ mala
luctuosæ</i>.” Spain was manifestly intended. But the wags
spreading all manner of doubts and difficulties, the “Dons”
were obliged to come out with a public notice, intimating
that “the gentlemen had better confine themselves to the
Spanish Peninsula!”</p>

<p>Cantabria, which is the scene of this poem, was likewise
the scene of some of Augustus’s victories. His policy
seems to have been here as successful as his generalship.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domuit autem, partim ductu, partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam.</span>”
(Sueton. <em>cap.</em> 20.) But the Cantabrians, then as
now unformed for subjugation, rebelled again the moment
Augustus returned to Rome. Augustus, however, paid
them a second visit, and appears to have quieted them in
Roman fashion, this being the last of his warlike exploits:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic finis Augusto bellicorum certaminum fuit: idem
rebellandi finis Hispaniæ.</span>” (Luc. Flor. <em>lib.</em> iv. c. 12.)</p>

<p>It was the proud distinction of the Cantabrian in the
ancient world to be indomitable, a character very significantly
assigned to him in Horace’s well known line:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantabrum indoctum juga ferre nostra.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Carm.</cite> ii. 6.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">In a later ode Horace commemorates the subjugation of
the Cantabrians, but it was only momentary, and the difficulty
with which it was effected is acknowledged by the
poet himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Servit Hispanæ vetus hostis oræ</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantaber, serâ domitus catenâ.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">These are splendid tributes to the valour which resisted
the then irresistible Roman power. The Cantabrian
strength was broken, and they were temporarily subjected
by Agrippa (Sueton. <cite>Octav.</cite> c. 20), but it was only to rise
again the moment they had recovered their shattered
forces.</p>

<p>Cantabria corresponded (as already observed) with the
modern Basque Provinces, and gave with the neighbouring
Asturia more trouble to the Romans than all the rest
of Spain, the mountainous character of the country aiding
them in that resistance to which they were prompted
by the hardy mountaineer’s character, and by his inherent
love of</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty!</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">“Two most powerful nations (says Florus, lib. iv. cap. 12),
the Cantabri and the Astures, were still free from the
Imperial sway. The determination of the Cantabrians was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pejor</i> (so the proud Roman calls it) and loftier, and more
pertinacious in rebellion, for not content with defending
their own liberty, they sought even to control their neighbours....
Beaten at last, they retired to the lofty mountain
Vinnius, to which they deemed that the Ocean would
ascend before the Roman arms.... But he in person
drew them from these mountains, and reduced them beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the crown by right of war.” Florus is here describing the
last expedition against the Cantabrians in the reign of Augustus,
of which Agrippa was commander. Suetonius
gives the same narrative in substance in <cite>Octav. cap.</cite> xx.,
and Strabo, <em>lib.</em> iii. Silius Italicus pays even a still
greater tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Cantabrians:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantaber ante omnes hyemisque, æstusque, famisque</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Invictus.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Horace in that variety of refined flattery, with whose
incense he knew how to intoxicate Augustus, returns frequently
to his Cantabrian wars, and while his object is to
praise the Roman pays unceasing tributes to Spanish
valour. Thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Cantaber non antè domabilis</p>
<p class="verse2" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miratur, ô tutela præsens</p>
<p class="verse4" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Italiæ dominæque Romæ!</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Carm.</cite> iv. 14.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Again, commemorating the triumph of Agrippa under Augustus,
in the year U. C. 733:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantaber Agrippæ, Claudî virtute Neronis</p>
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Armenius cecidit.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Epist.</cite> i. 12.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Agrippa was not the only one of Augustus’s generals, who
was despatched to the conquest of Cantabria, and with
dubious success. Lucius Æmilius had before failed in the

<p>In the Peninsula I do not expect much appreciation,
where even amongst those who palaver English, English
poetry is not at all understood, and where once a littérateur,
expressing his sham admiration of Shakspeare, spoke to me
of “<em>Macabets</em> as one progidy of a tradegy!” I am not
prepared to sacrifice to an ambition which nothing but
undue praise could conciliate, and I shall be satisfied with

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO I.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">In August, 1813, as the preparations for the renewed siege of San
Sebastian were advancing, the besieged demonstrated their confidence
by celebrating the Emperor’s birthday with a splendid illumination.
The castle, upon whose crest it was exhibited, is seen
from a great distance; and the besiegers could plainly read the
letters of fire in which the name of Napoléon was written
high in air.</p>

<p>The incidents of the siege I have derived chiefly from Napier’s
<cite>History of the War in the Peninsula</cite>, book xxii. chapters 1 and 2,
and from Jones’s <cite>Journals of Peninsular Sieges</cite>. The topography
of San Sebastian will be found sufficiently illustrated in either of
those works.</p>

<p>The small castle of La Mota is most picturesquely situated like a
crown on the conical hill of Monte Orgullo, which rising immediately
behind the town westward, is nearly four hundred feet
high, and washed by the sea. “The Hill has a broad base of 400
by 600 feet, and is crowned by fort La Mota.” Jones, <cite>Journal of
Peninsular Sieges</cite>, vol. ii.</p>

<p>General Jones’s description of cutting off the aqueduct, and
converting it into a globe of compression, is thus prosaic but
practical and deadly:&mdash;“The parallel crost a drain level with the
ground, 4 feet high, and 3 feet wide, through which ran a pipe to
convey water into the town. Lieut. Reid ventured to explore it, and
at the end of 230 yards, he found it closed by a door in the counterscarp,
opposite to the face of the right demi-bastion of the
hornwork: as the ditch was narrow, it was thought that by forming
a mine, the explosion would throw earth sufficient against the
escarpe, only 24 feet high, to form a road over it: eight feet at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
end of the aqueduct was therefore stopped with filled sand bags,
and 30 barrels of powder of 90 lb. each, lodged against it, and a
saucisson led to the mouth of the drain.” <cite>Journals of the Sieges
undertaken by the Allies in Spain</cite>, Supplementary Chapter. The
aqueduct had been cut off at the commencement of the siege by
the Spanish general, Mendizabal. “It was formed into a globe of
compression designed to blow, as through a tube, so much rubbish
over the counterscarp as might fill the narrow ditch.” Napier, <cite>Hist.</cite>
book xxi. c. 3. This plan was subsequently realized, and with
complete success, “creating” says Jones “much astonishment in
the enemy,” at the period of the first assault, which took place on
the 25th July, five weeks before the second and memorable
storming. I have transferred the incident to the latter part of
the siege.</p>

<p>The incident of the discovery of the spring upon Monte Orgullo
after the cutting off of the aqueduct, but for which fortunate accident
the town would have been probably forced to surrender much
sooner, was communicated to me by an officer who was present at
the siege. It was found about half way up the cliff where it overhangs
the ocean, and surrounded by masonry is carefully preserved
to the present day. The water is excellent, and the flow abundant.
There were not wanting French partisans at the time, especially
amongst the elderly female residents in San Sebastian, who believed
the discovery of this spring to be miraculous!</p>

<p>When Marshal Berwick attacked San Sebastian in 1719, he
threw up batteries on the same Chofre hills where the Allies now
planted theirs. He then pushed his approaches along the isthmus,
and established himself on the covered-way of the land front. As
soon as the breach was practicable, the governor capitulated. But
the present governor, Ney, was made of different stuff. Capitulation
was the last thing that he thought of, and Napoléon’s instructions
to the defenders of besieged towns were never more terribly
fulfilled than by this very gallant man. “Napoléon’s ordinance,”
says Napier, “which forbade the surrender of a fortress without
having stood at least one assault, has been strongly censured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
English writers upon slender grounds. The obstinate defences
made by French governors in the Peninsula were the results.
* * It may be reasonably supposed that, as the achievements of
Napoléon’s soldiers far exceeded the exploits of Louis (XIV.)’s
cringing courtiers, they possessed greater military virtues.”&mdash;<cite>Hist.</cite>
book xxii. c. 1.</p>

<p>The attack was in a great degree carried on from the midst of
“circling orchards.” From the ground taken up by the besiegers
to Ernani, the whole country is covered with orchards.</p>

<p>For the costume and other particulars of the Basque <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">barqueras</i>,
or boat-girls of the Bidassoa and Urumea, the reader is referred to
the tours of Madame D’Aulnoy and M. de Bourgoing. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">xaquetilla</i>
is a “little jacket” or spencer.</p>

<p>As reference is made to the Guerrillas in this canto, the following
brief sketch of the leaders may be acceptable:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mina was a man of powerful frame and noble aspect&mdash;a fine
specimen of Nature’s nobility. He was rather tall, of portly size,
with fine chest and shoulders, and gigantic arms. His features
were more English than Spanish in their aspect, being by no means
dark, and their expression powerful, dignified, and heroic. There
is a fine portrait of him in Somerset House, London. Like almost
all the Guerrilleros, however, he was cruel. The French, whom
they cut off by their most harassing mode of warfare, were mercilessly
slaughtered. Mina, who was of the common class of peasant-farmers,
began with a band of about twenty men whom he formed
from amongst his neighbours, appointing a sergeant and corporal.
Repeated successes and the character of the chief swelled this band
to 300 in number. Mina then appointed a lieutenant. The latter
plotted against his commander, and Mina shot him dead with a
pistol, after taxing him with his treason, in presence of his men.
The rough Spanish mountaineers liked his daring and resolute
character, his band swelled to a thousand, and his new lieutenant
again conspired to oust his leader. Mina had this man
drowned in a well. He was subsequently left unmolested in his
command, until his powerful genius organized and led an army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
At his death, which occurred about ten years since in Barcelona, he
was a Field Marshal, a Grandé of Spain, and Vice-Roy of Navarre.
His widow became Aya or Governess to the present Queen of
Spain, Isabel, and held that post till the expulsion of Espartero.
Mina had a brother, Xavier Mina, who entered the regular army at
an early period of life, and likewise rose to the rank of Field
Marshal. He was treacherously shot in Mexico by Morillo.</p>

<p>The Empecinado was in person a still finer man than Mina, but
of a much less pleasing aspect. His face was stamped with savage
resolution and ferocity. His appearance was strictly Spanish, his
complexion being much darker than that of Mina. Both were
black-haired, but the Empecinado’s was of a raven intensity of jet.
He was one of the strongest men in Europe, tall and square-built&mdash;a
Hercules to the eye as well as in reality. Some nearly incredible
feats are recorded of his prodigious strength. The last of all
was the most worthy of note, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'recals the main'">recalls the main</ins> incident of our
fine old English ballad of “Adam Bell, Clym o’ the Clough, and
William of Cloudeslie.” During the fatal year of the Duke of
Angoulême’s invasion, 1823, when so many Constitutionalists fell
victims to Ferdinand’s gloomy ferocity, and Riego was villainously
butchered at Madrid, the Empecinado was seized by the myrmidons
of Absolutism at a village about twenty miles distant, caged and
tortured for three days, and at the end of that time led out for
execution. At the foot of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">furca</i> or gallows-tree, with one
effort he burst the thick cord with which his arms were bound,
and seized a gun from one of the soldiers near him. Had he not
been instantly slain, there is little doubt that with the butt-end he
would have slaughtered a hecatomb of the satellites of power.
But the whole file poured their fire into him at once, and he was
hung notwithstanding, though the rope was adjusted on a corpse!
The Curate Merino was distinguished for bush-fighting, and a rather
treacherous and Parthian mode of assault, and his aspect corresponded
with his character. His influence over his comrades was
secured by promises of eternal happiness.</p>

<p>Blanca’s figuring in childhood in the character of an angel is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
thus accounted for. The feast of San Sebastian is every year a
great event in that ancient town. The celebration is in many
respects interesting, including a procession in which female children
chosen for their beauty take a very prominent part, bearing baskets
of flowers, arrows typical of the martyr’s fate, and other interesting
emblems. Their dresses are of the richest description&mdash;a little gaudy,
to be sure, but beneath the brilliant sky of Spain this is, perhaps,
excusable. They represent angels, and are provided with crowns
set with mock diamonds, rubies, and topazes of the largest size,
and with gauze wings bound round with gold or silver tissue.
Short skirts of the ballet class, satin shoes, and white silk stockings,
complete an array of splendour which excites, as may well be
believed, terrific admiration in their mammas and envy in all the
rest of the town. A chorus from time immemorial is sung to
celebrate their progress, of which the burthen is:</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More commemorates the housing of cattle in churches.
“They stop the course of agriculture, reserving only the churches,
that they may lodge their sheep in them.” (<cite>Utopia</cite>, book i.) Bayle
has a similar story in his Dictionary of an abbot who converted his
church into a stable, an example which was speedily followed by
revolutionary France. During the French invasion of Portugal the
cavalry were frequently quartered in churches, and during the
Miguelite war in that country I have been assured that the same
thing was witnessed more than once, and I know of a Constitutionalist,
at present a dignified, clergyman, who upon its being found
that the priest was absent upon some Saint’s festival, stept forward
himself and said mass for the assembled soldiers, booted and spurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as he was and in dragoon regimentals! I have often seen this pious
gentleman in Lisbon, whom the populace declare to have taken from
an image of the Virgin the ring which he now sports upon his
finger!</p>

<p>The batteries of Monte Olia commanded the Castle at a distance
of 1,600 yards, from the north side of the Urumea, Olia and
Orgullo buttressing the entrance of the river magnificently on
either side, and standing apart like giant ramparts.</p>

<p>A battery on the eastern side of Monte Orgullo. The
name signifies “a look out,” the use to which it was formerly
applied. It reminded me very much of the Signal House at
Gibraltar, only that I missed those sapphire and chrysolite tints
of the Mediterranean, which struck me so much when I saw the
moon rise from that elevated ground under the auspices of the
stalwart Sergeant MacDonald.</p>

<p>Tiryns is the first walled city upon record. Its walls were
supposed to have been erected by the Cyclops, and the stones of
which they were composed were of such prodigious size, that the
least of them could not be moved by a pair of oxen. (Pausanias, <em>lib.</em>
ii.) The ruins subsist to the present day, and the traces are still
gigantic. Pindar mentions Tiryns in his Olympionics, Nemeonics,
and Isthmionics. These shattered remains present the earliest

</p>

<p>The bayonet, originally a French invention (deriving, as is well
known, its name from the town of Bayonne), became ultimately the
very instrument of French defeat&mdash;for by the universal testimony
of military men, when wielded by British hands, the French have
invariably fled before it:&mdash;</p>

<p>But it would be as grossly unjust as ungenerous to dispute the ardour
and frequent brilliancy of French courage. Upon this subject
the discriminating testimony of Napier is as follows: “Place an attainable
object of war before the French soldier and he will make
supernatural efforts to gain it, but failing he becomes proportionally
discouraged. Let some new chance be opened, some fresh stimulus
applied to his ardent, sensitive temper, and he will rush forward
again with unbounded energy: the fear of death never checks him,
he will attempt any thing. But the unrelenting vigour of the
British infantry in resistance wears his fury out.”&mdash;<cite>Hist. War in

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO II.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p>For the incidents from ancient Spanish history with which this
Canto opens, the reader is referred to Livy (lib. xxi. et Epit.) or to
Ferguson’s <cite>Roman Republic</cite>, where a full account will be found of
the ever-memorable Sieges of Saguntum and Numantia. The ruins
of Saguntum (Liv. loc. cit.) or Sagunthus (Sil. Ital. lib. i.) are still
visible on the sea coast, a little to the north of Valencia. The
site of Numantia, having a much more central position, a few
miles north of Soria, capital of the small province of that name
in the eastern part of Old Castile, is more conjectural than that
of Sagunthus. The name of Numantia is erroneously spelled
“Numantium” in Mr. Lockhart’s <cite>Ancient Spanish Ballads</cite>, a
work of extraordinary merit, notwithstanding a few inaccuracies.
The particulars of the siege of Numantia are to be found in the
57th <cite>Epitome</cite> of Livy’s lost books. The Moorish invasion
under Tarik, the fall of Roderick, and the struggles of Pelayo,
are described or alluded to by Byron, Scott, and Southey. The
scene in the Vale of Covadonga is one of the finest passages in
the latter’s poem of <cite>Roderick</cite>, where huge masses of rock are
hurled down on the advancing Moorish host at the signal of the
following words pronounced by the heroine:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerxx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">&mdash;“<span class="smcap">In the name</span></p>
<p class="verse"><span class="smcap">Of God! For Spain and vengeance!</span>”</p>
<p class="verse16">Southey, <cite>Roderick</cite>. book xxiii.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The fight at Roncesvalles is the most memorable in the entire
range of Romantic History, and has been alluded to, amongst other
poets, by Pulci, Ariosto, Milton, Scott, and Lockhart. The siege
of Zaragoza will be found described in detail in a succeeding canto.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
The ferocity displayed by the Moors in their invasion appears to
have been not at all exaggerated by the Spanish chroniclers, and
it is curious that this fierceness of aspect should have been noticed
many centuries before by Horace:</p>

<div class="poetry-containerxx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer et Mauri peditis cruentum</p>
<p class="verse10" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vultus in hostem.</p>
<p class="verse16"><cite>Carm.</cite> i. 2.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The modern representations of Abd-el-Kader’s warriors by French
artists square with the ancient notions of the Moorish ferocity of
aspect. I myself have seen at Tangier and Gibraltar for the most
part fine-looking men, but certainly with a tinge of ferocity, and
here and therewith an expression worthy the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">truculentus Maurorum
vultus.</span>” The introduction of Mohammedanism seems to have
altered nothing in this respect, for in the days of Julius Cæsar, as
Horace here attests, the same physiognomy was apparent; and
Suetonius, speaking of the war between Cæsar and Juba, king of
Mauritania, represents even the Roman legions as affrighted: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Famâ
hostilium copiarum perterritos ... expectatio adventûs Jubæ terribilis.</span>”
<em>cap. 66.</em></p>

<p>The part which I assign to the Basque boat-girls, and the strain
of sentiment which pervades their oar-song, although not consonant
with a peaceful state of cultivated society, is quite characteristic
of Spain during the Peninsular War. The creed of Hippolytus
was not very favourable to those literate pretensions which Molière
has so pleasantly satirized in his “<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Précieuses Ridicules</cite>,” and the
Basque barqueras would be quite to his taste. The persecuted of
Phædra, whose uncompromising chastity caused his neck to be
broken, said:&mdash;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σοφὴν δὲ μισῶ</span>, “I hate a learned woman;” and
Blanca and her sisters of the oar appear to have extended that
hatred to both sexes.</p>

<p>Gen. Jones’s record of the seizure of the island of Santa Clara in
the mouth of the harbour is as follows:&mdash;“A party of 200 men
was landed this night on the high rocky island of Sta. Clara, and
made prisoners of the enemy’s guard on it, of an officer and twenty-four
men.” <cite>Journals, &amp;c., Supp. Chapt.</cite> Napier makes the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
party to consist of only 100 men&mdash;such difficulties does one meet
in ascertaining the minute parts of even recent history. But probably
Gen. Jones may have estimated that the seamen amounted to
another hundred. “A heavy fire was opened on them,” says Napier,
“and the troops landed with some difficulty, but the island was
then easily taken, and a lodgment made with the loss of only
twenty-eight men and officers.” <cite>Hist.</cite> book xxii. c. i. The historical
fact of the supplies having been conveyed to the besiegers
at San Sebastian by boat-girls gives warrant to the supposition that
they may have assisted in the capture of the Island.</p>

<p>This Canto describes the principal warlike operations between
the battle of Vittoria and the first battle of Sauroren, with a description
of the first part of which it terminates. The incidents
will be found in Napier’s <cite>History</cite>, book xxi. chap. 5.</p>

<p>The concluding incident is from the combat of Maya, which
took place in the same neighbourhood a few days previously, and
is thus described by Captain Norton, of the 34th regiment.&mdash;“The
ninety-second met the advancing French column first with its right
wing drawn up in line, and after a most destructive fire and heavy
loss on both sides, the remnant of the right wing retired, leaving a
line of killed and wounded that appeared to have no interval. The
French column advanced up to this line and then halted, the killed
and wounded of the ninety-second forming a sort of rampart; the
left wing then opened its fire on the column, and as I was but a
little to the right of the ninety-second, I could not help reflecting
painfully how many of the wounded of their right wing must have
unavoidably suffered from the fire of their comrades.” This frightful
butchery appears to excite the enthusiasm of some of its military
historians. “So dreadful was the slaughter,” says Napier, “that
it is said the advancing enemy was actually stopped by the heaped
mass of dead and dying; and then the left wing of that noble
regiment coming down from the higher ground smote wounded
friends and exulting foes alike, as mingled together they stood or
crawled before its fire. * * The stern valour of the ninety-second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
principally composed of Irishmen, would have graced
Thermopylæ.”&mdash;<cite>Hist. War. Penins.</cite> book xxi. chap. 5.</p>

</p>

<p>Rapidity of conception and execution were marked features in
Marshal Soult’s military character. The decree by which Napoléon
appointed him his Lieutenant in Spain was issued at Dresden on
the 1st July, 1813, ten days after the battle of Vittoria. On the
eleventh day he was in the midst of the army in Spain! “The
12th, Soult, travelling with surprising expedition, assumed the
command of the armies of the ‘north,’ the ‘centre,’ and the
‘south,’ now reorganized in one body called ‘the Army of Spain.’
And he had secret orders to put Joseph forcibly aside if necessary,
but that monarch voluntarily retired from the army.” Napier,
<cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xxi. chap. 4. “Marshal Soult
was one of the few men whose indefatigable energy rendered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
worthy lieutenants of the emperor; and with singular zeal, vigour,
and ability he now served.”&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em> “Such was Soult’s activity
that on the 16th all the combinations for a gigantic offensive
movement were digested.”&mdash;<em>Ibid.</em></p>


<p class="p2">
<span class="fs80">XXIX.</span><span class="pad4">&nbsp;</span>      “His rugged spine full many a peak doth bear,<br />
<span class="pad8">His ribs, huge ridges, part on either hand.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>This is the actual formation of the Pyrenees. A great spinal
ridge runs diagonally across this entire mountain tract, trending
westward. From this spine sierras shoot forth on both sides, and
the communications between the valleys formed by these ridges
pass over breaks in the sierras, called <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">puertos</i> by the Spaniards,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cols</i> by the French.</p>


<p class="p2">
<span class="fs80">XXXI.</span><span class="pad4">&nbsp;</span>      “What clattering steed doth gallop fleet as air.”<br />
</p>

<p>On the 27th July, Wellington, having been unable to learn any
thing of the movements of Picton and Cole, who had been left in
the valley of Zubiri and on the adjoining heights of Linzoain, on the
evening preceding, and dreading lest Soult’s combinations should
cut them off, quitted Sir Rowland Hill’s quarters in the Bastan at
a very early hour in the morning (these early matutinal movements
have been always characteristic of his Grace) and descending the
valley of Lanz, reached Ostiz, a few miles from Sauroren, where
he met General Long with his brigade of light cavalry, who informed
him that Picton and Cole had abandoned the heights of
Linzoain, and were moving on Huarte, “He left his quarter-master-general
with instructions to stop all the troops coming down
the valley of Lanz until the state of affairs at Huarte should be
ascertained. Then at racing speed he made for Sauroren. As he
entered that village he saw Clauzel’s divisions moving from Zabaldíca
along the crest of the mountain, and it was clear that the
allied troops in the valley of Lanz were intercepted, wherefore
pulling up his horse, he wrote on the parapet of the bridge of
Sauroren fresh instructions to turn every thing from that valley to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the right, by a road which led through Lizasso and Marcalain
behind the hills to the village of Oricain, that is to say in rear of
the position now occupied by Cole. Lord Fitzroy Somerset, the only
staff officer who had kept up with him, galloped with these orders
out of Sauroren by one road, the French light cavalry dashed in
by another, and the English general rode alone up the mountain to
reach his troops,” &amp;c.&mdash;Napier, <cite>Hist.</cite> book xxi. c. 5.</p>

<p class="pad4">
<span class="pad6">&mdash;“Thought-swift they make</span><br />

<p class="p2">
<span class="fs80">XXXII.</span><span class="pad4">&nbsp;</span>      “Cole eagle-eyed and gallant Picton.”<br />
</p>

<p>The gallantry of Picton and the keen observation of Cole were
eminent characteristics of those two generals respectively. The
danger which they ran in this instance was very imminent. Picton
“directed Cole to occupy some heights between Oricain and
Arletta. But that general having with a surer eye, &amp;c.”&mdash;Napier,
<cite>Hist.</cite> book xxi. c. 5. Wellington’s rapid riding on this occasion
defeated a very able combination of Soult’s. The Duke was
always an expert and eager horseman, and it was not for nothing
that he kept his pack of fox-hounds in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>“Lord Wellington suddenly stopped in a conspicuous place, he
desired that both armies should know he was there, and a double
spy who was present pointed out Soult, then so near that his
features could be plainly distinguished. The English general, it is
said, fixed his eyes attentively upon this formidable man, and,
speaking as if to himself, said: ‘Yonder is a great commander,
but he is a cautious one and will delay his attack to ascertain the
cause of these cheers; that will give time for the sixth division to
arrive and I shall beat him.’ And certain it is that the French

<p>General Ross’s brigade of the fourth division was posted on
this strongly contested height, having a Portuguese battalion
(the seventh caçadores, tenth regiment) in his front, with its flank
resting on the chapel. “The seventh caçadores shrunk abashed,
and that part of the position was won.” Napier, <em>ibid.</em> The
inequality with which the Portuguese fought was remarkable
throughout the Peninsular War. They fought well, or gave way,
in great measure according to the impulse of the movement. Here
they gave way, then inspired by the example of Ross’s brigade
renewed the combat, but again gave way. “Soon, however, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
rallied upon General Ross’s brigade * * and the tenth Portuguese
regiment fighting on the right of Ross’s brigade yielded to
their fury.” Napier, <em>ibid.</em> Sometimes they fought extremely well.</p>

<p>This epithet was well deserved by general Ross, and is assigned
to him by Napier. “That gallant officer.” Book xxi. c. 5. I am
proud to record the exploits of my countryman, whose name and
achievements are endeared to me by early recollections. A lofty
column is erected in his honour at the beautiful village of Rosstrevor,
within seven miles of which, at Newry, my early years from
infancy to the period of my going to College were passed. All my
summers were spent in and near Rosstrevor, one of the most
charming sea-bathing spots in the British dominions. The noble
Bay of Carlingford stretches before it, girt by an amphitheatre of
lofty hills, and Killowen Point, the Wood-house, Greencastle, the
light-house, and Grenore, with the ancient and picturesque town
of Carlingford, the stupendous mountain overhanging it, and the
bleak tract extending along to Omeath, contrasted with the sunny
and wooded slopes beyond, have left impressions indelible even
during much travel in foreign lands. I rejoice to perceive that a
railway is about to open up this magnificent region, and trust that
this new means of intercourse will be eminently beneficial to the
warm-hearted inhabitants of all the surrounding district.</p>

Trachinian treason, see Herodotus, <em>lib.</em> 7. Pindar does not name
Thermopylæ, but Cithæron being in its immediate neighbourhood
would make the allusion at once intelligible. Pindar with instinctive
good taste prefers the name “Cithæron” to that of “Thermopylæ,”
the latter name, though to us so magnificent, sounding
somewhat vulgar to Greek ears, as indicating the θερμὰ λουτρὰ, or

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO III.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p>This Canto describes the battles of Sauroren on the Pyrenees,
with the leading incidents in the minor combats of Buenza, Doña
Maria, Echallar and Ivantelly which followed. The first battle
of Sauroren took place on the 28th July, 1813, the fourth anniversary
of the battle of Talavera, and was remarkable for the
extraordinary valour displayed by the French under Soult, which,
having obtained a slight success at Buenza, they repeated with
almost frantic efforts at Echallar and Ivantelly on the 2nd August,
their principal object being to relieve San Sebastian. But in vain.
Lord Wellington described the first of these actions as “bludgeon
work.” The loss on both sides was very considerable; but it was
here demonstrated by our soldiers, in the words of Napier “that
their opponents however strongly posted could not stand before
them.” The actions will be found detailed in his History, book xxi.
chap. 5.</p>

<p>The incident of the defence of the mountain top by flinging
down rocks, is taken from the previous combat, where it occurred
as described by Napier in the following words: “The British,
shrunk in numbers, also wanted ammunition, and a part of the
eighty-second under Major Fitzgerald was forced to roll down
stones to defend the rocks on which they were posted.” (<cite>Hist. ibid.</cite>)
The allusions to Sisyphus and to Ajax will I trust be excused. It
is difficult to exaggerate such incidents. There was surely something
Titanic in the character of this Pyrenean warfare.</p>

<p>The Spanish regiment which gave way towards the end of the
battle (the poor soldiers were starved by their miserable commissariat)
was that of El Pravia, which was stationed on the left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the fortieth, and the latter regiment justly styled by Napier the
“invincible” victoriously concluded the combat. “Four times
this assault was renewed, and the French officers were seen to pull
up their tired men by the belts, so fierce and resolute they were to
win. It was, however the labour of Sisyphus.” (Napier, <em>ibid.</em>) The
cavalry engagement was maintained by our tenth and eighteenth
hussars. I occasionally detach my heroes, Nial and Morton, to
other infantry corps for poetic effect.</p>

<p>The terrible scene at the bridge of Yanzi is described by Captain
Cooke in his <cite>Memoirs</cite> as follows:&mdash;“We overlooked the enemy
at stone’s throw, and from the summit of a tremendous precipice.
The river separated us, but the French were wedged in a narrow
road with inaccessible rocks on one side and the river on the other.
Confusion impossible to describe followed, the wounded were
thrown down in the rush and trampled upon, the cavalry drew
their swords and endeavoured to charge up the pass of Echallar,
but the infantry beat them back; and several, horses and all, were
precipitated into the river; some fired vertically at us, the wounded
called out for quarter, while others pointed to them supported as
they were on branches of trees, on which were suspended great
coats clotted with gore, and blood-stained sheets taken from
different habitations to aid the sufferers.”</p>

<p>The incident of extricating Wellington by the agency of Nial
and Morton from his imminent peril of falling into the hands of
the French is taken from the following passage at the end of
Napier’s description of the combat of Ivantelly: “Lord Wellington
narrowly escaped the enemy’s hands. He had carried with him
towards Echallar half a company of the forty-third as an escort,
and placed a sergeant named Blood with a party to watch in front
while he examined his maps. The French who were close at hand
sent a detachment to cut the party off; and such was the nature
of the ground that their troops, rushing on at speed, would infallibly
have fallen unawares upon Lord Wellington, if Blood, a young
intelligent man, seeing the danger, had not with surprising activity,
leaping rather than running down the precipitous rocks he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
posted on, given the general notice, and as it was the French arrived
in time to send a volley of shot after him as he galloped away.”
(<cite>Hist.</cite> book xxi. c. 5.)</p>

<p>The prodigies accomplished by our Peninsular veterans, of which
this and the preceding Canto fall short in the narration, need
little attestation. But here is the testimony of one of Napoléon’s
Generals:&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien que leurs corps soient robustes, leurs ames
énergiques, et leurs esprits industrieux,</span>” &amp;c. (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre.
Pénins.</cite> liv. ii.) “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Prince-Noir et Talbot étaient nés dans Albion.
Marlborough et ses douze mille soldats n’avaient pas été les moins
redoutables ennemis de Louis XIV. * * Nos soldats revenus
d’Egypte disaient à leurs camarades la valeur indomptée des
Anglais. Il n’etait pas besoin d’une réflexion profonde pour
déviner que l’ambition, la capacité, et le courage sont bons à autre
chose qu’à être embarqués sur des vaisseaux.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>) “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Leur
humeur inquiète et voyageuse les rend propres á la vie errante des
guerriers, et ils possèdent une qualité, la plus précieuse de toutes
sur les champs de bataille, le calme dans la colère. * * Telle est
la puissance Anglaise. C’est Bonaparte en action, mais Bonaparte
toujours jeune et toujours vigoureux, Bonaparte persévérant dans sa
passion, Bonaparte immortel.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>) “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le soldat Anglais ...
son corps est robuste. Son ame est vigoureuse, parceque son père
lui a dit et ses chefs lui répétent sans cesse que les enfants de la
vieille Angleterre, abreuvés de <em>porter</em> et rassasiés de bœuf roti,
valent chacun pour le moins trois individus de ces races pygmées
qui végètent sur le continent d’Europe. * * Il marche en avant.
Dans l’action, il ne regarde pas à droite ni à gauche.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>The brilliancy of our cavalry service is equally acknowledged,
though French military writers strive sometimes to mock it,
very ineffectually, as in the following example; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans la retraite
de la Corogne, les corps de cavalerie faisaient halte; le chef commandait:
<em>Pied à terre; prenez vos pistolets</em>; et à un troisième
commandement, chaque cavalier brûlait la cervelle à son cheval en

<p>In illustration of the character of Napoléon, of which I have
attempted some analysis in this Canto, I have drawn together a
few striking passages from the most eminent military writers of
England and France, Napier and Foy:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That greatest of all masters of the art of war.” (Napier, <cite>Hist.
War in the Penins.</cite> book xxiv. chap. 6.) “In following up a
victory the English general fell short of the French emperor. The
battle of Wellington was the stroke of a battering ram, down went
the wall in ruins. The battle of Napoléon was the swell and dash
of a mighty wave, before which the barrier yielded and the roaring
flood poured onwards covering all.” (<em>Ibid.</em>) “That successful
improvisation in which Napoléon seems to have surpassed all
mankind.” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vaincre et trouver des instruments de victoire était le travail
de sa vie.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre. Pénins.</cite> liv. i. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Caractère de
Napoléon.</i>)</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jamais esprit plus profondément meditatif ne fut plus fécond
en illuminations rapides et soudaines.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours prêt à combattre, habituellement il choisissait l’occasion
et le terrain. Il a donné quarante batailles pour huit ou dix qu’il a
reçues.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>“Napoléon’s system of war was admirably adapted to draw
forth and augment the military excellence and to strengthen the
weakness of the national character. His discipline, severe but
appealing to the feelings of hope and honour, wrought the quick
temperament of the French soldiers to patience under hardship,
and strong endurance under fire. * * He thus made his troops,
not invincible indeed, nature had put a bar to that in the character
of the British soldier, but so terrible and sure in war that the
number and greatness of their exploits surpassed those of all other
nations.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xxiv. chap. 6.)</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce n’est pas avec les règles de Montécuculli et de Turenne
manœuvrant sur la Renchen qu’il faut juger de telles entreprises.
Les uns guerroyaient pour avoir tel ou tel quartier d’hiver; l’autre,
pour conquérir le monde. Il lui fallait souvent non pas seulement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
gagner une bataille, mats la gagner de telle façon qu’elle épouvantât
l’Europe et amenât des résultats gigantesques. Ainsi les vues
politiques intervenaient sans cesse dans le génie stratégique. * *
Quelque habile qu’on soit, il y a presque toujours dans ce jeu
terrible des risques proportionnés à la grandeur des profits. Le
succès est devenu plus chanceux. Les armées étaient plus nombreuses.
Ses ennemis, à son exemple, ont eu aussi des masses. * *
La machine n’était plus maniable; il a été écrasé.</span>” (Foy, liv. i.)</p>

<p>Napoléon’s was a game of double or quits played with the
hardihood of a determined gambler. The value of the stakes became
multiplied with alarming rapidity, as in the arithmetical problem
of the horse-shoe-nails. All the military population and resources
of the empire became involved in the chances of the die, and he
lost the last throw.</p>

<p>General Foy narrates the following anecdote. He was probably
himself the interlocutor: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dans la campagne de France, aux premiers
mois de 1814, Napoléon parlait à Troyes en Champagne,
avec un de ses généraux, de l’état des choses. ‘Les ennemis, disait
celui-ci, sont trop nombreux; il faut que la France se lève’&mdash;‘Eh!
comment voulez-vous que la France se lève, interrompit
avec vivacité Napoléon; il n’y a pas de noblesse, <em>et j’ai tué la
liberté!</em>’”</span></p>

<p>Of the love which the French people bore to Napoléon, let his
march to Cannes be a witness, where the inhabitants, as he passed,
surrounded him in hundreds of thousands with unmistakeable demonstrations
of blind enthusiasm and delight. Not even the terrible
conscription could rase his impression from their hearts.
The general equity of his internal administration, the exact system
of his public accounts, the effectual discharge of duty which
he required of the state servants, the abolition of idle privileged
classes, and the cessation of fraud in the management of the revenue
or its punishment when detected, caused the people to love him as
they everywhere love justice. Napoléon, with all his other splendid
faculties, was a skilful financier; he was opposed to public loans,
and left no debt. He had no private views, and his active energies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were unimpaired in his vassals’ service. The utility of his public
works was commensurate with their grandeur, providing at once
employment for the poor and embellishment for the country. His
Code was a monument of legislative wisdom, and his Cadastre an
invaluable equalizer and register of taxation and the liabilities of
property. But withal he was a detestable tyrant.</p>

<span class="pad7">In Orcus tortured flung.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The epithet “feigned” is imitated from Milton’s treatment of
similar subjects. But Milton was not at all uniform in his treatment;
and therefore having paid this tribute to the truth of Christianity
and entered by this word my protest against the fables of Polytheism,
I do not think it necessary, any more than Milton did, to
be perpetually marring poetical effects by intimating that comparisons
are derived from fictitious subjects. Thus in the finest
book of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, the second, all the Greek and Roman fables
are introduced with excellent effect, and without any intimation
that they are apocryphal. Thus</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO IV.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The gathering under the oak of Guernica, the onset of the
French light horse, and the resistance of the peasantry, described
in this Canto, are incidents which, although imagined, are characteristic
of this heroic struggle at various periods. The part here
played by Blanca was not uncommon during the Peninsular War,
enthusiast emissaries having made their appearance in various
quarters, preaching the crusade against the French. They literally
preached, or harangued the people in public places. I met an
Englishman in the Peninsula who had figured in that capacity.
Women, too, undertook the same service, which amongst an excitable
Southern people was found to be most potential. The
appearance of the fair sex in this character was chiefly after the
siege of Zaragoza, when the renown won by Manuela Sanchez
caused heroines to spring up in several places, who wore for the
most part a half-military attire. Blanca’s use of the guitar is
strictly in character, for the talent of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">improvvisatore</i> is pretty
general in Spain, the language readily adapting itself to extemporaneous
recitation in verse, and the ardent temperament of the
nation favouring a rapid exercise of the imagination. The Basque
drum or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pandero</i>, and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">gaita</i> or bagpipe, belong to this district.
The Oak of Guernica, beneath which I make Blanca rhapsodize,
was one of the most venerable natural monuments in Spain. Here
the Biscayan legislators, hidalgos and peasants, periodically assembled,
and here Ferdinand and Isabella in 1476 swore to maintain
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fueros</i>, or ancient rights and privileges of the people. Wordsworth
has a sonnet on the subject; but unhappily his “tree of
holier power” was cut down by the French. An oak sapling was,
however, planted under the protection of the English army to
replace it.</p>

<p>The idea of the night-sortie in this canto is taken from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
following passage in Napier:&mdash;“In the night of the 27th, about
3 o’clock, the French sallied against the new battery on the
isthmus; but as Col. Cameron of the ninth regiment met them
on the very edge of the trenches with the bayonet, the attempt
failed, yet it delayed the arming of the battery.” (<cite>Hist. War in the
Penins.</cite> xxii. 1.) I have made honourable mention of Cameron’s
achievement in my first canto, but without specifying that the
sortie took place by night. The attack in the real incident was
so speedily repelled that it afforded no room for poetical description.
I have therefore worked up separately here the idea of a
sortie with the numerous picturesque additions incident to its
occurrence by night, and have taken some of these incidents from
the sortie which took place from Bayonne, then invested by Sir
John Hope, on the night of the 13th April 1814&mdash;three days after
the Battle of Toulouse&mdash;being therefore the last event of the
Peninsular War, in which Sir John Hope was made prisoner, and
great loss of life occurred owing to the French governor’s incredulity
as to the abdication of Napoléon. It is described in Napier’s
last chapter but one, and still more minutely in Capt.
Batty’s <cite>Campaign of the Left Wing of the Allied Army</cite>, &amp;c.
Though Sir Thomas Graham was intrusted with the conduct of
the siege of San Sebastian, and though at the period of the assault
Wellington was engaged with the allies, as described in a succeeding
canto, at some distance from the town, I am warranted in making him
superintend the defence of this sortie, he having visited the works
frequently during their progress, and having actually visited them
on the day (the 28th August) on which this sortie took place.
The present is almost the only instance throughout the poem,
where there is exaggeration of the actual amount of fighting and
its consequences.</p>

<p>The French in desolating the fields of Spain, and sweeping off
their sheep and cattle by thousands, professed that they did it for
the people’s good, treating them, doubtless, as Sir Thomas More
makes the Utopians treat their useless members in his Happy Republic:
“Wrought on by these persuasions, they do either starve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
themselves of their own accord, or they take opium, and so they
die without pain.” (<cite>Utopia</cite>, book ii.) According to Hobbes’s
philosophy, this could be doing them no injury, “for he who consents
to any thing, cannot consider himself injured.” (<cite>De Cive.</cite>
1. i. c. iii.) This voluntarily inflicted suicide Bishop Burnet in
his preface more justly characterises as “a rough and fierce philosophy.”
Still fiercer was the “philosophy” of Republican France.</p>


<p class="p2">
<span class="fs80">V.</span><span class="pad4">&nbsp;</span>      “What were thy mural crowns, bellipotent Rome?”<br />
</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona muralis</i> was a crown of gold, bearing some resemblance
to an ancient wall with turrets, given to him who first
scaled the walls of a city in an assault. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona castrensis</i> sive
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallaris</i> was a crown given to the soldier who first mounted a
rampart, or invaded the enemy’s camp. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona obsidionalis</i>
(Livy) was a crown composed of the grass which grew in a besieged
place, and presented to the general who raised a siege.
This was deemed one of the highest military honours. Thomasius
says that it was likewise given “to a captain that razed a fort.”
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona triumphalis</i>, originally of laurel and in after ages of
gold, was worn by those generals who had received the honour of
a triumph. On its being sent to the general, it insured him the
triumph on his return, and he immediately obtained the title <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperator</i>,
which he retained till his triumphal entry. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona
ovalis</i> sive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">myrtea</i> (Aulus Gellius) was given to a general for a
victory without slaughter of men. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona civica</i>, the highest
of all these rewards, was composed of oaken boughs, and given to
him who had saved the life of a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>“For the end of war is in hands, but of words in council;

barks loudest is least inclined to bite, or, as the German proverb
has it: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die grossen marterhausen sind nicht die besten kriegsleut.</span>”
I may add here Suidas’s excellent derivation of Arês <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄρης</span>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

</p>

<p>The word <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rimbombar</i>, signifying “to resound terrifically,” especially
as applied to thunder and discharges of artillery, is a very
forcible specimen of onomatopœia, and is common to the Spanish,
Italian, and Portuguese; I have therefore ventured to adopt it
into the English language. Tasso uses the word with fine effect
in one of his most celebrated passages:&mdash;</p>

<p>Virgil’s treatment of his subject, the forging of the armour of
Æneas, presents a curious contrast to Homer’s treatment of the
forging of the armour of Achilles. Vulcan is the agent in both

do it all himself, with the assistance only of “twenty pairs of
bellows:”&mdash;</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO V.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">In the account of the Storming of San Sebastian, which occupies
this and part of the next Canto, I follow chiefly Napier’s <cite>History</cite>,
book xxii. chap. 2. The part which I assign to Nial in leading the
false assault on the night of the 29th of August was in reality undertaken
and bravely executed by Lieutenant Mc Adam of the 9th
regiment. As stated in my text, the leader was the only one of
the entire party that returned alive! The storming took place on
the morning of the 31st August, 1813. The leader, Lieutenant
Maguire of the 4th regiment (whose name I have restored to its
antique Celto-Irish form, “Mac Iar”) was struck down precisely
as described in my text. (See Napier.) The following account
is from Gleig’s <cite>Subaltern</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The forlorn hope took its station at the mouth of the most
advanced trench about half-past ten o’clock. The tide, which had
long turned, was now fast ebbing, and these gallant fellows beheld
its departure with a degree of feverish anxiety such as he only can
imagine who has stood in a similar situation. This was the first
time that a town was stormed by daylight since the commencement
of the war, and the storming party were enabled distinctly
to perceive the preparations which were making for their reception:
there was, therefore, something not only interesting but
novel in beholding the muzzles of the enemy’s cannon from the
castle and other batteries turned in such a direction as to flank
the breaches, whilst the glancing of bayonets and the occasional
rise of caps and feathers gave notice of the line of infantry which
was forming underneath the parapet. There an officer from time
to time could be distinguished leaning his telescope over the top
of the rampart or through the opening of an embrasure, and prying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with deep attention into our arrangements. Nor were our own
officers, particularly those of the engineers, idle. With the greatest
coolness they exposed themselves to a dropping fire of musketry,
which the enemy at intervals kept up, whilst they examined and
re-examined the state of the breaches. It would be difficult to
convey to the mind of an ordinary reader anything like a correct
notion of the state of feeling which takes possession of a man
waiting for the commencement of a battle. In the first place,
time appears to move upon leaden wings, every minute seems an
hour, and every hour a day. Then there is a strange commingling
of levity and seriousness within him, a levity which prompts him to
laugh he scarce knows why, and a seriousness which urges him ever
and anon to lift up a mental prayer to the Throne of Grace. On
such occasions little or no conversation passes. The privates generally
lean upon their firelocks, and the officers upon their swords,
and few words except monosyllables, at least in answer to questions
put, are wasted. On these occasions, too, the faces of the bravest
often change colour, and the limbs of the most resolute tremble,
not with fear but with anxiety, whilst watches are consulted till
the individuals who consult them grow absolutely weary of the
employment. On the whole, it is a situation of higher excitement
and darker and deeper agitation than any other in human life, nor
can he be said to have felt all which man is capable of feeling who
has not filled it.</p>

<p>“Noon had barely passed, when the low state of the tide giving
evidence that the river might be forded, the word was given to
advance. Silent as the grave the column moved forward. In one
instant the leading files had cleared the trenches, and the others
poured on in quick succession after them, when the work of death
began. The enemy, having reserved their fire till the head of the
column had gained the middle of the stream, then opened with the
most deadly effect. Grape, canister, musketry, shells, grenades,
and every species of missile, were hurled from the ramparts,
beneath which our gallant fellows dropped <em>like corn before the
reaper</em>; in so much, that in the space of two minutes the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was literally choked up with the bodies of the killed and wounded,
over whom, without discrimination, the advancing division pressed
on. The opposite bank was soon gained, and the short space
between the landing-place and the foot of the breach rapidly
cleared without a single shot having been returned by the assailants.
But here the most alarming prospect awaited them.
Instead of a wide and tolerably level chasm, the breach presented
the appearance only of an ill-built wall thrown considerably from
its perpendicular, to ascend which, even though unopposed, would
be no easy task. It was, however, too late to pause; besides, the
men’s blood was hot and their courage on fire, so they pressed on,
clambering up as they best could, and effectually hindering one
another from falling, each by the eagerness of the rear ranks to
follow those in front. Shouts and groans were now mingled with
the roar of cannon and the rattle of musketry: our front ranks
likewise had an opportunity of occasionally firing with effect, and
the slaughter on both sides was dreadful. At length the head of
the column forced its way to the summit of the breach, where it
was met in the most gallant style by the bayonets of the garrison.
When I say the summit of the breach, I mean not to assert that
our soldiers stood upon a level with their enemies, for this was
not the case. There was a high step, perhaps two or three feet
in length, which the assailants must surmount before they could
gain the same ground with the defenders, and a very considerable
period elapsed ere that step was surmounted. Here bayonet met
bayonet, and sabre met sabre, in close and desperate strife, without
the one party being able to advance or the other succeeding in
driving them back.”</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO VI.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The incidents of the first part of this Canto are derived in common
from Napier, Jones, and Gleig. The tearing down of the Tricolor,
which I have assigned to Nial, must be historically attributed to
the real performer of this bold exploit.</p>

<p>“The French colours on the cavalier were torn away by Lieutenant
Gethin of the eleventh regiment.”&mdash;Napier, <cite>Hist.</cite> book xxii.
chap. 2.</p>

<p>The magnificent achievement of maintaining for a considerable
period a fire from our whole artillery, against the curtain wall, over
the heads of the storming party, is thus coldly, but (on the whole)
accurately, described by General Jones:&mdash;“From the superior
height of the curtain, the artillery in the batteries on the right of
the Urumea, were able to keep up a fire on that part during the
assault, without injury to the troops at the foot of the breach, and
being extremely well served, it occasioned a severe loss to the
enemy, and probably caused the explosion which led to the final
success of the assault.” The General’s coldness is owing to the
departure from the rules of art, and to the contempt of the maxims
of “Marshal Vauban, who had served and directed at fifty sieges,”
as he triumphantly describes him. Vauban’s maxim was certainly
not British: “At a siege never attempt any thing by open force,
which can be obtained by labour and art.” Gen. Jones is incorrect
in stating that the fire on the curtain was “without injury to
the troops.” Napier says: “A sergeant of the ninth regiment was
killed by the batteries close to his commanding officer, and it is
probable that other casualties also had place.” <cite>Hist.</cite> book xxii.
chap. 2.</p>

<p>The impassable chasm beyond the breach is thus described by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Jones: “At the back of the whole of the rest of the breach was a
perpendicular wall, from fifteen to twenty-five feet in depth.”
(<cite>Journals of Sieges</cite>, Sup. Chap.) He thus describes the advance of
the Portuguese column: “Five hundred Portuguese, in two detachments,
forded the river Urumea near its mouth, in a very handsome
style, under a heavy fire of grape and musketry.” (Jones,
<cite>Journals of Sieges</cite>, Sup. Chap.) This does not quite do justice to
the gallantry of the party. “When the soldiers reached the middle
of the stream,” says Napier, “a heavy gun struck on the head of
the column with a shower of grape; the havoc was fearful, but
the survivors closed and moved on. A second discharge from the
same piece tore the ranks from front to rear, still the regiment
moved on.”&mdash;<cite>Hist.</cite> book xxii. c. 2.</p>

<p>The following account is from Gleig’s <cite>Subaltern</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Things had continued in this state for nearly a quarter of an
hour, when Major Snodgrass, at the head of the thirteenth Portuguese
regiment, dashed across the river by his own ford, and assaulted
the lesser breach. This attack was made in the most cool
and determined manner, but here, too, the obstacles were almost
insurmountable; nor is it probable that the place would have been
carried at all but for a measure adopted by General Graham, such
as has never perhaps been adopted before. Perceiving that matters
were almost desperate, he had recourse to a desperate remedy,
and ordered our own artillery to fire upon the breach. Nothing
could be more exact or beautiful than this practice. Though our
men stood only about two feet below the breach, scarcely a single
ball from the guns of our batteries struck amongst them, whilst
all told with fearful exactness among the enemy. The fire had
been kept up only a few minutes, when all at once an explosion
took place such as drowned every other noise, and apparently confounded,
for an instant, the combatants on both sides. A shell
from one of our mortars had exploded near the train which communicated
with a quantity of gunpowder placed under the breach.
This mine the French had intended to spring as soon as our troops
should have made good their footing or established themselves on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the summit, but the fortunate accident just mentioned anticipated
them. It exploded whilst 300 grenadiers, the élite of the garrison,
stood over it; and instead of sweeping the storming party into
eternity, it only cleared a way for their advance. It was a spectacle
as appalling and grand as the imagination can conceive, the
sight of that explosion. The noise was more awful than any which
I have ever heard before or since, whilst a bright flash, instantly
succeeded by a smoke so dense as to obscure all vision, produced
an effect upon those who witnessed it such as no powers of language
are adequate to describe. Such, indeed, was the effect of
the whole occurrence, that for perhaps half a minute after not a
shot was fired on either side. Both parties stood still to gaze upon
the havoc which had been produced! insomuch, that a whisper
might have caught your ear for a distance of several yards. The
state of stupefaction into which they were at first thrown did not,
however, last long with the British troops. As the smoke and
dust of the ruins cleared away, they beheld before them a space
empty of defenders, and they instantly rushed forward to occupy
it. Uttering an appalling shout, the troops sprang over the
dilapidated parapet, and the rampart was their own. Now then
began all those maddening scenes which are witnessed only in a
storm, of flight and slaughter, and parties rallying only to be
broken and dispersed, till finally, having cleared the works to the
right and left, the soldiers poured down into the town.”</p>

<p>It is nearly incredible, and certainly not very creditable, that
General Jones in his detailed account of the siege and storming of
San Sebastian, says not one word of the horrible excesses which
our soldiers there committed. Some men’s notions of history do
not differ very widely from the concoction of a political pamphlet.
Napier’s history abounds with frank admission and reprobation of
these horrors. I find a distinct allusion to them almost at its
very commencement: “No wild horde of Tartars ever fell with more
license upon their rich effeminate neighbours, than did the English
troops upon the Spanish towns taken by storm.”&mdash;<cite>Hist. War
Penins.</cite> i. 5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The part which the Portuguese took in this assault was sufficiently
creditable to make quite unnecessary the boasting spirit
which disfigures their national literature. It abounds in the great
work of their greatest poet. Thus, for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerxx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Que os muitos por ser poucos não temamos;</p>
<p class="verse" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">O que despois mil vezes amostramos.</p>
<p class="verse16">Camóens, <cite>Lus.</cite> viii. 36.</p>
</div></div>


<p>“We don’t fear many because we are few, which we have shown
a thousand times!” And in the previous stanza he relates that
“seventeen Lusitanians, being attacked by 400 Castilians <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">(desasete
Lusitanos subidos de quatro centos Castelhanos)</span>, not only defended
themselves, but offended their adversaries!!”</p>

<div class="poetry-containerxx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Que não só se defendem, mas offendem!</p>
</div></div>

<p>This ridiculous boasting and inane swagger, which was a vice in
the Portuguese blood in the days of Camóens, exists unchanged to
the present hour, and has been disgustingly manifested in a piece
called “Magriço” lately selected for the opening of the National
Theatre at Lisbon, in which Spaniards and Englishmen are alike
insulted. “We are not accustomed to count numbers!” was a
sentiment vehemently applauded in this piece. Let the Portuguese
not deceive themselves by an imagined resemblance to their
forefathers; and if their historical recollections are glorious, let
them endeavour practically to revive them. They should remember
that it is little more than a century since their entire army
ran away from the Spaniards and French at Almanza, and left
their English, Dutch, and German auxiliaries in the lurch.</p>

<p>“The stalwart son of Jove measured out a grove divine to the
mightiest Father, and hedged it round, and the Altis he set apart
in that sacred place.” Pindar thus attributes the foundation of
the Olympic games to Hercules, who was more popular than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Jupiter himself amongst his Heraclidan audience; and a few lines
before he alludes to his conquest of Elis, on whose plain these
games were subsequently celebrated, “<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυχοῖς ἅμμενον Ἄλιδος;</span>”
Hercules having led thither an army from Tiryns, the first walled
city upon record. The sacred grove to which Pindar above refers
contained the temple of Olympian Jove, and the statues erected to
the conquerors in the games. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρισολυμπιονῖκαι</span>, or those who
had been thrice victorious, had their <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκόνες</span> in marble thus set,
and copied exactly from their members, which were thus in some
degree deified. (Plin. lib. 34, cap. 3.) And Aristotle, in his <cite>Ethics</cite>,

his cloth is made of a finer thread; for, how fine soever that thread
may be, it was once no better than the fleece of a sheep, and
that sheep was a sheep still for all its wearing it. They wonder
much to hear that gold, which in itself is so useless a thing, should
be every where so much esteemed that even man, for whom it was
made, and by whom it has its value, should yet be thought of less
value than it is; so that a man of lead, who has no more sense
than a log of wood, and is as bad as he is foolish, should have
many wise and good men serving him, only because he has a great
heap of that metal; and if it should so happen that by some accident,
or trick of law, which does sometimes produce as great
changes as chance itself, all this wealth should pass from the master
to the meanest varlet of his whole family, he himself would
very soon become one of his servants, as if he were a thing that
belonged to his wealth, and so were bound to follow its fortune.
But they do much more admire and detest their folly who, when
they see a rich man, though they neither owe him anything, nor
are in any sort obnoxious to him, yet merely because he is rich,
they give him little less than divine honours; even though they
know him to be so covetous and base-minded that, notwithstanding
all his wealth, he will not part with one farthing of it to them as
long as he lives.”&mdash;Sir Thomas More, <cite>Utopia</cite>, book ii. Bishop

<p>“An army come in ships, anarchical, and ferocious for evil
deeds, but useful when it pleases.” A very close description of
our San Sebastian heroes&mdash;written more than two thousand years
since! I stood in September last upon the Chofre hills, on the
very spot whence Graham directed the fearful cannonade, and subsequently
beneath the branch where our gallant fellows entered,
and in the recollection of their bravery could readily forget the
tales of horror which I heard from Spaniards, who retain a more
vivid memory of misdeeds, than of the most magnificent services.</p>

<p>I saw with little admiration the mediocre picture of San Sebastian
over the high altar in the cathedral, and when I subsequently
beheld the glorious picture of the same saint by Guido in the
museum at Madrid, I sincerely regretted that the latter is not substituted
for the former&mdash;a measure which would be well worthy an
enlightened government.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO VII.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">For the incidents connected with Napoléon’s invasion of Portugal
and Spain, and for the state of both monarchies at that
period, the reader is referred to Napier’s and Southey’s Histories
of the Peninsular War, and (with the necessary caution in the
perusal) to Thiers’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire</cite>. I have
endeavoured to adhere as closely to historical truth as the nature
of poetical composition would permit. My residence in both
Peninsular countries, since they were visited either by Southey or
Napier, has enabled me to add some additional particulars, derived
from sources exhibited of late years, which tend to throw fresh
light upon these transactions.</p>

<p>The Emperor commenced with the invasion of Portugal, for
various reasons, of which the chief was probably that, as there was
no family alliance between France and Portugal, as between France
and Spain, an injustice done to the former country would be less
shocking and startling to the common feelings of mankind. That
Napoléon himself regarded an invasion of Spain in that light is
evident from a remarkable expression which he used in conversation
with his aide-de-camp, Savary:&mdash;“I am always afraid of a change
of which I do not see the scope: the best plan of all would be to
avoid a war with Spain, it would be a kind of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacrilege</i> (he used
the expression); but I shall not shrink from making it.”&mdash;Thiers,
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire</cite>.</p>

<p>When Junot entered Lisbon, the old Queen of Portugal was
mad, and the Prince Regent possessed no vigour of character to
supply the sovereign’s intellectual deficiencies. These were supposed
to be in great measure chargeable upon the superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
terrors with which her head had been filled by Dom José Maria de
Mello, Bishop of Algarve and Grand Inquisitor of the Kingdom.
Influenced partly by fear of Junot, and partly by the popular discontent
with the fugitive government, (for the entire Royal family
and Court of Portugal fled to Brazil the moment it was ascertained
that Junot was on his march close to Lisbon, and left the poor
miserable country to shift for itself,) the principal ecclesiastics of
the kingdom, with a subserviency too characteristic of that order
in every country, worshipped the rising sun, and lavished their
despicable incense upon Junot and Napoléon. Cardinal Mendoza,
the Patriarch of Lisbon, issued a pastoral sounding the praises of
“the man whom past ages had been unable to divine, the man of
prodigies, the Great Emperor whom God had called to establish
the happiness of nations!” At the voice of this reverend Prince
of the Church, the bishops and clergy, and in imitation of them the
civil magistrates, recommended it to the faithful and to the people
generally, as a binding civil and religious obligation, to receive the
French cordially and pay obedience to their General. This language
was especially noticeable in the mouth of the Inquisitor
General, since he had always been heard to profess principles of the
most diametrically opposite character. Against the “impious revolutionists”
of France he had been the first to fulminate his censures.
He had sought to re-establish <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">autos-da-fé</i>, in all their original
bloody ferocity, under the reign of his august but crazy
penitent. And at the commencement of the revolution he had
seriously proposed the excommunication of the French nation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
masse</i> by the dignified clergy of Portugal.</p>

<p>The concentration of Junot’s troops around Lisbon made the reception
of the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> a matter of little difficulty. But it
is not a little curious that the voice of old prophecy was made to
contribute to the same result. The Nostradamus of Portugal,
Bandarra, had predicted these changes as conformable to the will
of God, and the triumph of the imperial eagle of Napoléon might
be read in his prophetic quatrains. Curiously illustrative are these
details of the character of a people of whom it has (with some exaggeration)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
been said that one half are waiting for the coming of
Dom Sebastian, and the other half for that of the Messiah. The
prophecy of Bandarra struck the nation with astonishment, and
for a time they regarded it as literally fulfilled. The closeness of
realization was certainly astounding. Gonzalo Annes Bandarra
was a poor cobbler of Trancoso in the district of Guarda, who
composed about the year 1540 some prophecies which have ever
since obtained great reputation in the country, amongst all classes.
His <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">trovas</i> or <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">redondilhas</i> (rhymed quatrains) have been printed
several times, and in 1809 an edition was published at Barcelona.
When the French entered Lisbon in 1807, the event was found by
the believers in prophecy to be not only clearly predicted in
Bandarra, but the Imperial power to be precisely indicated, and
the first letter of the name of Napoléon, in the 17th and 18th
quatrains of the third prophetic dream, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-containerxx"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq" lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">“Ergue-se a Aguia imperial</p>

<p>“The Imperial Eagle rises, with his children at his tail, and with
his claws before him makes his nest in Portugal. Put an A with
its legs upside down; take away its middle bar, and put this bar
behind it. You will know him I name.” The coarseness of the
wording belongs to the era and to the popular literature of Portugal
generally. The N and the imperial eagle are made out perfectly.
The coincidence does not quite convince, but in the words of the
hero of the Gridiron story, “it is mighty remarkable!”</p>

<p>Junot proceeded to depose the Royal House of Portugal with
the coolest unconcern, and from the old Palace of the Inquisition,
where he established his Intendance Générale, and upon whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
ruins the new National Theatre has just been raised, he issued a
proclamation declaring that “the dynasty of Braganza had ceased
in Portugal!” Meanwhile Solano, a creature of Godoy’s, who had
accompanied Junot to Lisbon, was active on behalf of his infamous
master, whose obscure birth-place I lately saw at Badajoz, and
substituted in several public acts the name of the King of Spain
for that of the Prince Regent of Portugal. He created a Chief
Judge and a Superintendent of Finances, and both employments
were conferred upon Castilian subjects. Solano was the intimate
confident of the Prince of the Peace, and it is believed that it was
not without superior orders that he proceeded in these hasty innovations.
The future Sovereign of the Algarves, as designated in the
secret treaty with Napoléon, was so impatient to reign on his own
account that, if the reports which prevailed at the period are to be
believed, dollars were struck at the Madrid mint, bearing upon
one side the head of Godoy with the legend <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emmanuel primus
Algarviorum dux</i>, and on the other the ancient arms of the kingdom
of Algarve.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival Junot proceeded, as he phrased it,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">inaugurer avec éclat à Lisbonne le drapeau tricolore français.</span>”
The Portuguese had previously received them as friends: this
outrage opened their eyes. It was on a Sunday; 6,000 men of all
arms were assembled in the great square of the Rocio, to be reviewed
by the General. Mid-day sounded. A salvo of artillery
resounded from the Castle of St. George, originally built by the
Moors. Every eye was turned towards these ancient walls, which
topple over the city somewhat like the Calton Hill at Edinburgh.
In an instant was seen to fall the standard of Portugal which
floated before on the loftiest tower of the Castle, while its place
was taken in another instant by a foreign flag surmounted by the
imperial eagle! To describe the outraged feelings of the Portuguese,
to paint their indignation and horror, is impossible. Their
loyalty and their national pride are almost the only virtues which
they retain. Their southern hatred was excited to terrific intensity.
Conceive what would be the feelings of veteran warriors, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
have dragged out the remnant of an existence spared by the
missiles and casualties of war, to see the flag beneath which their
blood has flowed insulted by its enemies. Some idea may then be
formed of the grief and rage which took possession of the people
of Lisbon. A torrent of bitterness deluged their souls. The sacred
standard which was thus supplanted was consecrated alike by religious
feelings and by secular remembrances of glory. It had
been given, according to popular belief, by Christ himself to
Afonso Henriques, the founder of the Monarchy, impressed by the
Redeemer with the marks of his Passion, for the five shields of the
conquered Moorish kings displayed on the Quinas were likewise
said to be typical of the Sacred Wounds, and with this other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labarum</i>
their new Constantine had been told to “go forth and conquer.”
“<em>Death to the French!</em>” was soon the cry, but the
cannon and paraded soldiery of Junot suppressed the insurrectionary
movement.</p>

<p>The earthquake, stated in the text to have occurred at the period
of the French entry into Lisbon, is strictly historical. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le lendemain
de l’entrée des Français on éprouva dans Lisbonne une
légère secousse de tremblement de terre, qui fit monter la mer sur
les quais.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre. Pénins.</cite> liv. ii.) Junot wrote thus
impiously concerning this event to the Minister of War, Clarke.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les dieux sont pour nous; j’en tiens l’augure de ce, que le tremblement
de terre ne nous a annoncé que leur puissance sans nous
faire de mal!</span>”</p>

<p>Napoléon’s treatment of Spain was not characterized by the
same daring recklessness, but by what must be regarded as unprincipled
profligacy. One of his own generals, Baron Foy, calls
the Spanish invasion “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une traîtreuse usurpation.</span>”&mdash;<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre.
Pénins.</cite> liv. ii.</p>

<p>A Spanish army entered Portugal under Junot in 1807, with
absurd and astounding ignorance mistaking the English for enemies,
and the French for friends, to both Peninsular countries.
The Marquis del Socorro, who commanded this army, was the tool
of the infamous Godoy and the French, and it is thus he spoke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
us in the proclamation which he issued at Oporto. He declared
his object to be “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de vous délivrer de la perfide domination et de
la politique ambitieuse des Anglais. * * Tous ensemble, nous
vengerons les outrages que la férocité traîtresse des Anglais a faits
à toutes les nations de l’Europe!</span>”&mdash;Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Guerre. Pénins.</cite>
liv. ii. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i>.</p>

<p>The unsuspected testimony of Foy leaves the fearful iniquity
of Napoléon’s seizure of the principal fortresses of Spain
beyond dispute. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y eut,</span>” says he, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans les moyens par
lesquels on s’en rendit maître, un mélange de l’astuce des faibles
et de l’arrogance des forts. On n’employa que la ruse pour Pampelune
et Saint-Sébastien.</span>” (liv. iii.) The following is his detailed
account of the seizure of these several fortresses:&mdash;The castle of
Montjuic at Barcelona was too difficult of approach for the troops
to reach it without being perceived. Duhesme went to the Count
d’Ezpeleta, Captain-General of the province: “My soldiers occupy
your citadel,” said he. “Open to me this instant the gates of Montjuic;
for the Emperor Napoléon has ordered me to place a garrison
in your fortresses. If you hesitate, I declare war against Spain,
and you will be responsible for the torrents of blood which your
resistance will have caused to flow.” The name of Napoléon produced
its accustomed effect. The Spanish General was aged and
timid, and the only instruction which his government had given
him was to avoid taking any step which might embroil them with
France. He resigned the keys of Montjuic, and General Duhesme
became master of Catalonia. Thus fell without striking a blow,
into the power of France, the largest city of the Spanish monarchy&mdash;a
city which a century before had struggled single-handed, after
all Spain had submitted, against the power of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The gates of the fortress of Pamplona had been opened to the
French general Darmagnac as to a friend. But the military authority
remained in the hands of the Viceroy, Marquis de Valle-Santoro,
and the volunteer battalion of Tarragona, 700 men strong,
was lying in the citadel, and performed the military service of the
place. Since Cardinal Cisneros, regent of Castile, dismantled all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the strong places of Navarre, with the exception of its capital, the
received opinion has been that he who commands in Pamplona is
master of the province. To command in Pamplona, it is requisite
to obtain possession of the citadel. This fortress, built by Philip
II., contains within it extensive magazines for munitions of war
and mouth, and might hold out for an indefinite period. The
French soldiers came on fixed days, in undress and unarmed, to
receive their provisions in the interior of the citadel. The Spanish
troops maintained a strict guard upon these occasions, and never
failed to have the drawbridge raised during the entire time that the
distribution lasted. During the night of the 15th February, 1808,
Darmagnac collected 100 grenadiers at his lodgings, which he had
taken “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non sans dessein</i>,” says Foy, on the esplanade which separates
the town from the citadel. They entered their general’s residence
with their firelocks and cartouches, one after the other, in
profound silence. At seven o’clock on the morning of the 16th,
sixty men went to receive their provisions as usual, but were commanded
by an officer of intelligence and daring named Robert.
Under pretext of waiting for the quarter-master, the men stopt,
some of them on the drawbridge and some beyond it. The drawbridge
was thus prevented from being raised. It rained; and some
of them entered the guard-house, as it were to escape from the
shower. “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A un signal donné</i>,” (says Foy) they leapt upon the
arms of the guard, where they lay ranged at one side; and
the two sentinels were immediately disarmed. The Spaniards
could not extricate themselves from the hands of the French, who
filled the guard-house. Those who made any resistance were beat
with the butt-ends of muskets. By this time arrived the grenadiers
who had been lying in ambuscade at the general’s house. They
proceeded straight to a bastion of 15 guns, directed on the entrance
to the ditch. The forty-seventh French battalion, quartered
not far distant, followed close on the grenadiers. The rampart
was covered with Frenchmen, before the Spanish garrison,
shut up in their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casernes</i>, had even thought of putting themselves
on their defence. Darmagnac announced to the Viceroy and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Council of Navarre that, as he would probably have some stay to
make in Pamplona, he had been obliged for the security of his
troops to introduce into the citadel a battalion which would do
duty there in concert with the national garrison&mdash;“a slight change,
he added, which, instead of altering the good understanding between,
them, should only be regarded as a tie the more between two reciprocally
faithful allies!”</p>

<p>Ties of a similar character became established daily. Thouvenot,
General of Brigade, had been sent to San Sebastian, with a
commission to assemble in one dépôt the soldiers who arrived from
France on their way to join their respective corps in Spain. “This
dépôt (concludes Foy) becoming presently very numerous found
itself in possession of the place, without the detachments of the
Spanish regiments of the King and of Africa, who formed the garrison,
perceiving it. It is thus that the French became masters of
Figuera, Barcelona, Pamplona, and San Sebastian; and then their
military operations in the Peninsula became placed on a reasonable
basis! The mask was thrown off, the interested observers whom
Spain had received as allies, for a time dissembled their projects,
but they no longer sought to conceal the means which they adopted
for their accomplishment.”&mdash;<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre. Pénins.</cite> liv. iii.</p>

<p>Yet these are the events which Thiers, in his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat
et de l’Empire</cite>, has the coolness to describe, without one
word of reprobation, censure, or comment, in the following words:</p>

<p>“As soon as the French troops crossed the frontiers they were
quartered at Saint Sebastian, Pampeluna, Rosas, Figueras, and
Barcelona.”</p>

<p>Of the character and deeds of Godoy, the chief actor in these
transactions, the following brief but on the whole satisfactory
sketch is given by Thiers:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This man, whom an extraordinary degree of favour had raised
up to the supreme power in Spain, governed the state as an absolute
master for more than ten years; he had confirmed his power
by filling the government offices with his creatures. He had
become the dispenser of every favour and every boon, and was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
completely the medium of the king’s decisions, that the monarch
answered to every applicant: ‘Call upon Emanuel,’&mdash;the prince
being named Emanuel Godoy. This supreme authority had stirred
up against him a general detestation, which had counterbalanced
the favour he enjoyed, because he had of course committed many
acts of injustice in building up his power. The Prince of Asturias
was in the cabinet; he likewise had to complain of the favourite’s
haughtiness, the Prince of Peace not fearing to irritate him by exhibiting
the source of a despotic sway which laid its burden even
on the successor to the crown. The Prince of Asturias became
his enemy, and lost no opportunity of contriving his destruction, in
which object he was encouraged by the opinion of the people.</p>

<p>“On every side murmurs rose against the Prince of Peace; his
influence began to decline; and he was soon driven to his last and
lowest shifts to prop it up. <em>He had long since felt the necessity
of consolidating his power, and had striven by every art to acquire
the friendship of France.</em> His enemies availed themselves of
this circumstance to injure him, and charged him with treachery;
asserted that he wanted to sell Spain to France, and had reduced
her already to one of those vice-royalties obedient to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>“On the other hand (so mutable and various is the public mind)
they attributed to France whatever evil afflicted Spain, and accused
her of supporting the Prince of Peace. This state of things every
day produced fresh bickerings between the partisans of the rival
princes; the counsels of the Prince Royal were not always prudent,
and he was induced by the aversion of the people towards his
powerful opponent to endeavour to quell the ambition of the
Prince of Peace by making him the victim of his immoderate thirst
for power. The favourite, foreseeing the coming catastrophe, and
all Spain in arms to crush and overthrow him, gave himself up for
lost, when the French troops advanced into the Spanish territory,
to execute the treaty of Fontainebleau, <em>of which he alone possessed
the secret, and which was not even signed</em>.”</p>

<p>The Basque glories, which I have recorded in the ballad of “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Tartar Town,” are all strictly historical. The Basque dialect
was once spoken all over Spain, and is nearly identical with the
Tartar language. I use this supposed Tartar origin for poetical
purposes. Ever since the death of Ferdinand VII., the Basque
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fueros</i> have been a constant bone of contention. Espartero
abolished, but Narvaez partially restored them. The only <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fueros</i>
now retained are an exemption from duty upon stamps, salt,
and tobacco.</p>

saddening recollections. The toils of my pilgrimage will have

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO VIII.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">For the long series of historical incidents, of which this Canto
records only as much as appears to come within the province of
poetry, the reader is referred to the Histories of Napier and
Southey, and to Thiers’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire</cite>, as
well as to the work of Foy, which will bear comparison with any
of those mentioned.</p>

<p>With regard to Godoy’s character and conduct, I have read most
carefully his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite> published some years back in Paris; but
to many of the statements in that book it is impossible to give
credit, and to the view which I have taken of his career in this
and the last Canto I cannot but strongly adhere.</p>

<p>Foy thus describes him and the Royal family of Spain:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On vit Godoy s’élancer de la couche adultère de la reine aux
premiers grades de la milice, à la présidence des conseils, au gouvernement
absolu de la paix et de la guerre. * * Le roi
d’Espagne n’avait pas quarante mils soldats en Europe. Ses arsenaux
étaient dégarnis, son trésor était vide. Les dons patriotiques
arrivèrent de toutes part. La Catalogne demanda à se lever en
masse. Les provinces de Biscaye et de Navarre firent des appels
à la population. Les grands seigneurs accoururent à la tête de
leurs vassaux. Les moines arrivèrent enrégimentés. Des bandes
de contrebandiers, oubliant leurs démêlés habituels avec le gouvernement,
demandèrent à combattre les ennemis du trône et
de l’autel. Tous les états, tous les rangs voulurent vaincre ou
mourir pour la patrie. Quel parti tira le gouvernement espagnol
de tant de dévouement? * * Le général des Franciscains
offrit de marcher à la tête de dix mille moines. Le duc d’Albe
et deux autres seigneurs voulurent lever dix mille hommes à leurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
frais. Le chapitre de Toléde offrit vingt-cinq millions de réaux. Le
clergé parcourait les villages le crucifix à la main.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
Guerre. Pénin.</cite> liv. iv.) All was useless. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aucun exploit, aucune
vertu, n’honorèrent sa jeunesse, il n’avait pas tiré l’épée pendant la
guerre. Il ne montra pendant la paix ni talent dans les conseils,
ni détermination dans le gouvernement.</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>A curious parallel for the fortune of Godoy, and for the popular
hatred which he excited, is to be found in Horace:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Menas, Pompey’s freedman, and Augustus’s Tribune, a double
and impartial traitor, to whom this ode was addressed, was the
Godoy of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>The Massacre of Madrid on the memorable Second of May did
not happily involve so much bloodshed as for a long period had
been imagined. The exaggeration common to all countries in
commemorating their patriotic struggles, and especially so in the
Peninsula, had fully quadrupled the number of martyrs who fell
upon that occasion. Recent minute inquiries have confirmed the
statement of Napier that the entire number of the Madrid population
slain in this massacre did not exceed 200. The real name
of the “Daïz” in the text was Daoiz. The shootings subsequent
to the street massacre took place, as I have recorded them, under
circumstances which in Spain were necessarily regarded as of
excessive atrocity, the denial of the assistance of clergy, which by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Frenchmen was lightly considered, being in Spanish eyes the acmé
of horrors. The supposed miraculous appearances in the Northern
provinces are derived from Foy’s <cite>History</cite>.</p>

<p>For the circumstances of the rising which followed throughout
Spain the reader is referred to Napier and to Southey, whose description
of the Siege of Zaragoza I have followed because it is the
more poetical, although I cannot refrain from remarking that it is
disfigured by occasional passages of exaggeration and bombast
not altogether worthy of an historical work.</p>

<p>The state of political knowledge in Spain at the period of the
French invasion may be inferred from the character of the questions
treated by their publicists. An old Spanish political writer,
held in the greatest esteem down to that period, D. Diego Saavedra
Faxardo, formally discusses this thesis: Whether is it better for
a prince to delegate his authority to one or many? and concludes
in favour of delegation to a single person, for the following reason,
stated in his own words: “That the King is the image of the sun,
and when the sun disappears from the horizon, he leaves to one
only, the moon, and not to several, the care of presiding over the
night!” The political work from which this morçeau is extracted
was composed for the instruction of the Prince of the Asturias,
who afterwards became Carlos II. It was long the French system
to keep Spain in this state of pupillage. Choiseul, the ablest
minister of France during the 18th century, said that he was more
certain of his preponderance in the cabinet of Madrid than in that
of Versailles! He said this in the reign of Carlos III., the ablest
of the Spanish Bourbons. Up to the end of the last century,
France was the planet, and Spain the satellite.</p>

<p>The first era of the Peninsular campaigns comprised our two
first victories of Roriça and Vimieiro, more intrinsically glorious
perhaps, than any of their successors, but rendered futile in their
consequences by the mistaken generosity of concession which characterized
the Convention of Cintra.</p>

<p>The second period of the War was commenced by the battle of
Talavera, previously to which Wellington found the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
General Cuesta equally unmanageable, stubborn, and foolishly
arrogant, as the Portuguese General showed himself on the eve
of the battle of Roriça which commenced the first period of the
War. In both cases the results were the same. After a great
deal of vapouring about “doing the business themselves and not
needing British assistance,” both worthies retired, leaving the
sole and undivided honour of each day to the genius and fortune
of Wellington. In the preliminary combat of Alcabon, the Spanish
division (4,000 infantry, 2,000 horse, and 8 guns) scampered
off from before the French, and it was manifest that they could
not be depended on. Wellington was therefore determined that
they should withdraw to Talavera, where there was strong ground
suited for defence, on which alone the Spaniards were likely to
make a stand. Cuesta boastingly replied that “he would fight
where he stood.” The 27th, at daylight, the British General
renewed his solicitations, at first fruitlessly; but when the enemy’s
cavalry came in sight, Cuesta sullenly yielded, yet turning to his
staff with frantic pride observed that “he had first made the Englishman
go down on his knees!” (Napier, <cite>Hist. W. P.</cite> b. viii.
c. 2.) In the next preliminary combat of Salinas, the Spanish
army to the number of 11,000 men (including artillery) threw
down their arms, and ran away, declaring that the Allies were
entirely routed! It might have been so but that their example
was despised. Thus undivided glory was thrust upon Wellington;
and ever after the part which the Spaniards took was very subordinate.</p>

<p>After the battle of Talavera, the Spaniards were shamefully
defeated (having regard to the truth of History it is impossible
to use any other expression) by the French in two successive
actions&mdash;those of Arzobispo and Almonacid, at both of which
they threw down their arms and ran, and in the latter were
slaughtered in thousands&mdash;a result partly attributable to the
bad conduct of the men and partly to the bad guiding of
their commander, Cuenca, whose character was a concentration
of all the worst possible qualities of a General. “King” Joseph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
who had retreated after the battle of Baylen, now returned to
Madrid. Embarrassed by these disasters, by the perfidious withholding
of supplies, by the perpetual crossing and opposition of
the Spanish juntas, which like those of Portugal, instead of an aid,
were for ever a thorn in the side of their Liberator, Wellington,
in the face of an overwhelming French force, took the resolution
of retiring into Portugal. The conduct of the Spaniards may be
best estimated from his own words, stating his reasons for declining
again to co-operate with them:</p>

<p>“But there was a more shameful consideration, namely, the
constant and shameful misbehaviour of the Spanish troops before
the enemy. We in England never hear of their defeats and flights,
but I have heard Spanish officers telling of nineteen or twenty
actions of the description of that at the bridge of Arzobispo,
accounts of which, I believe, have never been published. * * *
In the battle of Talavera, in which the Spanish army, with very
trifling exception, was not engaged&mdash;whole corps threw away their
arms, and ran off, when they were neither attacked nor threatened
with an attack. When these dastardly soldiers run away, they
plunder everything they meet. In their flight from Talavera they
plundered the baggage of the British army, which was at that
moment bravely engaged in their cause.”</p>

<p>When Wellington came to this resolution to retire into Portugal,
he was at the head of only 17,000 British troops of all arms; the
“terror-stricken Spaniards” were literally an incumbrance. (Napier,
<cite>Hist. W. P.</cite> b. viii. c. 5.) Our troops, through the faithlessness
of their allies, were almost starving, and they were confronted
by 70,000 French! The wonder is that they were not
utterly and immediately crushed by the latter. But Soult was
the only great General then amongst the French commanders;
and the promptness is as much to be admired as the prudence
with which Wellington retired into Portugal.</p>

<p>The Spanish army made some miserable attempts after this at
independent action against the French, which ended four months
after the battle of Talavera in the disastrous battle of Ocaña, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of the most frightful routs recorded in history, where the whole
Spanish army of more than 50,000 men was destroyed, having
5000 killed and wounded, and leaving 26,000 prisoners, 45 pieces
of artillery, 30,000 muskets, and 3000 horses and beasts of burden
in the hands of the enemy! The French lost but 1700 men,
killed and wounded; and I must do them the justice of saying
that no exploit of ours in the Peninsula equalled this in its numerical
results; for God forbid that I should obscure the glory of an
enemy or gloss over the misconduct of an ally. The rest of the
Spanish army was subsequently defeated at Alba de Tormes, which
closed the campaigns of 1809.</p>

<p>These scattering and consuming thunderbolts opened the eyes of
the Spaniards at last to the value of the British alliance, and threw
the defence of the Peninsula entirely into those heroic hands, by
which it was so brilliantly completed. The soldiery of Spain acted
thenceforth a subordinate part, and the boast after the battle of
Baylen, “We will not need the services of you <em>Ingleses</em>&mdash;we will
escort you home through France, but you will not have to strike a
blow!” was not again repeated. For six months of the next year
(till Wellington re-appeared on the scene) they continued their
despairing efforts against the French, but with uniform defeat and
failure. No fitting leaders appeared, and the efforts of the people
were worse than useless.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> era of the Peninsular campaigns commenced with the
third invasion of Portugal by the French army, which was this
time commanded by Massena. The battle of Busaco was the great
event of the commencement of this campaign. This powerful
check was for the time successful, but unable long to control a
far superior force, and the British army fell back within the lines
of Torres Vedras. Massena arrived in front of them, and made
prodigious efforts to pass. But this triumph of Wellington’s genius,
and marvel of engineering and strategic skill, was impregnable to
all assaults, and was at once the salvation of Portugal and the
ultimate means of rescuing Spain from the Invader. Emerging
from his unassailable redoubt, Wellington at last pursued the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
beyond the frontier, and defeated them on the Spanish soil in
battle, action, and assault, from Salamanca to Vitoria, from Vitoria
to the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>One can laugh at this distance of time at the monstrosities
written about these memorable struggles by French nobles and
generals. Thus Foy has the coolness to say of the relative numbers
at Vimieiro, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Anglois étaient deux contre un par rapport
aux Français!</span>” (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre. Pénins.</cite>, livre ix.) He further
denies that it was <em>a battle at all</em>. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils n’étaient pas desireux de
changer un avantage défensif bien caractérisé en une bataille dont
le succès leur paraissait incertain!</span>” (<em>Ibid.</em>)</p>

<p>The political sagacity and military skill of Wellington not only
maintained his position in the face of overwhelming difficulties,
but speedily took the offensive. The co-operation of (Lord) Beresford,
who was placed over the Portuguese army, organized by
the genius of Wellington, and led by British officers, must not be
overlooked. Massena was forced to retreat from Portugal; and as
he passed the border-line of the two Peninsular countries, Wellington
followed victorious and menacing, having achieved what
at first appeared utterly vain to attempt. The battle of Fuentes
de Onoro ensued, the French were forced to evacuate the fortress
of Almeida, and then followed a long career of victory to the British
arms, which was uninterrupted till our triumphant entry into Toulouse,
and the news of Napoléon’s abdication.</p>

<p>The allusion in this Canto to the Basque Guerrillas needs a word of
explanation. The Chapelgorris and Chapelchurris are distinguishing
names of the Basque mountain peasantry, derived from the
colour of their caps. Chacolin is the thin, sour wine of the district.
During the late Carlist war, a considerable degree of romantic
interest attached to these peasantry for the keenness of
their partisan admixture in the strife. One of the most famous
events in the Carlist struggle was the siege of Bilbao, which was
raised by the Cristino General Cordova, and where the most
famous of modern Guerrilleros, Zumalacarregui, received his death-wound.
Had this most energetic of the Carlist Generals lived, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
war might have had a very different termination. It was he, who,
on the wretchedly unprovided state of his men as to arms being
remarked to him, pointing to the muskets in the Cristino battalions,
said, “There are their arms!” and contrived to arm them
very respectably by stripping the Cristinos in repeated brilliant
surprises. The circumstances of this rude but powerful hero’s
death are recorded in the Cristino song:</p>

<p>These heroines were by no means singular in their courage and
constancy, at that eventful era. Blanca is, I trust, no inaccurate
type of that multitude of heroic women who sprang up in all
parts of Spain during the Peninsular War, who rose superior to
the weakness of their sex in the face of invasion and its attendant
horrors, and who resembled more the Antigones than the
Ismenes of ancient history. It was theirs to falsify the familiar
reproach:</p>

<p>“For Woman is full of fear, and weak for the combat and at

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO IX.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The terrible scenes consequent upon the siege and storming of
San Sebastian, which occupy considerable portions of this and the
preceding Canto, and form in their bare recital an illustration
never surpassed of the horrors of War, are attested by so many
authorities, that to enter into minute corroborative details would
far exceed the limits which I have prescribed to myself. The following
brief but vigorous description is from Gleig’s <cite>Subaltern</cite>:</p>

<p>“The reader will easily believe that a man who has spent some
of the best years of his life amid scenes of violence and bloodshed,
must have witnessed many spectacles highly revolting to the purest
feelings of our nature; but a more appalling picture of war passed
by&mdash;of war in its darkest colours,&mdash;those which distinguish it when
its din is over&mdash;than was presented by St. Sebastian, and the
country in its immediate vicinity, I certainly never beheld. Whilst
an army is stationary in any district, you are wholly unconscious of
the work of devastation which is proceeding&mdash;you see only the
hurry and pomp of hostile operations. But, when the tide has
rolled on, and you return by chance to the spot over which it has
last swept, the effect upon your mind is such, as cannot even be
imagined by him who has not experienced it. Little more than a
week had elapsed, since the division employed in the siege of St.
Sebastian had moved forward. Their trenches were not yet filled
up, nor their batteries demolished; yet the former had, in some
places, fallen in of their own accord, and the latter were beginning
to crumble to pieces. We passed them by, however, without
much notice. It was, indeed, impossible not to acknowledge, that
the perfect silence which prevailed was far more awful than the
bustle and stir that lately pervaded them; whilst the dilapidated
condition of the convent, and of the few cottages which stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
near it, stripped, as they were, of roofs, doors, and windows, and
perforated with cannon shot, inspired us with gloomy sensations.</p>

<p>“As we pursued the main road, and approached St. Sebastian
by its ordinary entrance, we were at first surprised at the slight
degree of damage done to its fortifications by the fire of our batteries.
The walls and battlements beside the gateway appeared
wholly uninjured, the very embrasures being hardly defaced. But
the delusion grew gradually more faint as we drew nearer, and had
totally vanished before we reached the glacis. We found the
draw-bridge fallen down across the ditch, in such a fashion that
the endeavour to pass it was not without danger. The folding
gates were torn from their hinges, one lying flat upon the ground,
and the other leaning against the wall; whilst our own steps, as
we moved along the arched passage, sounded loud and melancholy.</p>

<p>“Having crossed this, we found ourselves at the commencement
of what had once been the principal street in the place. No
doubt it was, in its day, both neat and regular; but of the houses
nothing now remained except the outward shells, which, however,
appeared to be of an uniform height and style of architecture. As
far as I could judge, they stood five stories from the ground, and
were faced with a sort of freestone, so thoroughly blackened and
defiled as to be hardly cognizable. The street itself was, moreover,
choked up with heaps of ruins, among which were strewed
about fragments of household furniture and clothing, mixed with
caps, military accoutrements, round shot, pieces of shells, and all
the other implements of strife. Neither were there wanting other
evidences of the drama which had been lately acted here, in the
shape of dead bodies, putrefying, and infecting the air with the
most horrible stench. Of living creatures, on the other hand, not
one was to be seen, not even a dog or a cat; indeed, we traversed
the whole city without meeting more than six human beings.
These, from their dress and abject appearance, struck me as being
some of the inhabitants who had survived the assault. They looked
wild and haggard, and moved about here and there, poking among
the ruins, as if they were either in search of the bodies of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
slaughtered relatives, or hoped to find some little remnant of their
property.” For an account of the excesses committed by our
soldiery after the storming, “atrocities degrading to human
nature,” see Napier’s <cite>History</cite>, book xxii. chap. 2. Mr. Ford’s
denial, in his otherwise valuable Hand-book, deserves much censure.
I heard those horrors detailed on the spot.</p>

<p>The operations on the Pyrenees on the day of the storming of
San Sebastian, with the rival manœuvrings of Soult and Wellington,
the combat of San Marcial, in which the Spaniards behaved so well,
and the several remarkable incidents of which I have sought to
avail myself, will be found fully recorded in Napier’s <cite>History</cite>,
book xxii. chap. 3. The scene of these, and the subsequent operations,
struck me at passing as grand and majestic in the highest
degree&mdash;the lofty and broken Pyrenean range, more fitted, as I
have elsewhere remarked, for the combats of Titans than of men.
The very names have a majestic sound, and their associations are
often supernatural. I have warrant for the lines:&mdash;</p>

witchcraft in ancient times:&mdash;“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las trasformaciones y maleficios,

so-called witches were condemned to be whipped publicly in 1810
by the Inquisition of Logroño.</p>

<p>“For Truth doth govern in the Zephyrian Locri’s city, and
Calliope is their care, and likewise brazen Mars.” A magnificent
eulogy is conveyed here in a few words. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀτρέκεια</span> in the original
has the force both of Truth and Justice. No people of antiquity
were more renowned for the excellence of their institutions
than the Locri, who were the first to make use of written laws.
(Strabo, <em>lib.</em> 6.) Calliope is used by synecdoche for the Muses, to
whom the Locri were greatly devoted, having invented the Locric
harmony which was subsequently imitated by Sappho and Anacreon.
(Athenæus, <em>lib.</em> xiv. et xv.) Their warlike character upon fitting occasions
was also terribly displayed, 10,000 Locri having put to flight
130,000 invading Crotonians on the banks of the river Sagra&mdash;a fact
which, at first doubted as impossible, was afterwards strictly
verified, and passed into a proverb. (Strabo, <em>lib.</em> 6.) The epithet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
“brazen” applied here to Mars arises from the singular fact that
iron did not enter into the composition of the Grecian arms, which
were all of brass. (Pausanias, <cite>in Laconicis</cite>, and Homer <em>passim</em>.)
The magnificent region of Locris was situated at the foot of Parnassus;
and the splendid pre-eminence of its inhabitants in arts
and arms, with their prodigious victory over the Crotonians,
appears to justify their comparison with England.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO X.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The Passage of the Bidasoa, with the military movements which
immediately ensued, completing that operation and establishing the
left wing of our army on the soil of France, occupies the entire of
this Canto. The events with which it deals will be found very
fully and satisfactorily recorded in Napier’s <cite>History</cite>, book xxii.
chap. 4. The thunder-storm which rolled over the district on
the eventful morning chosen by Wellington for this remarkable
strategical evolution is by no means exaggerated in the text. It
is in the Pyrenees that thunder is witnessed to perfection. The
exploits which in this Canto I attribute to Nial have all their
foundation in the genuine history of the campaign.</p>

<p>General Alten had the command of the Light Division, and the
Rifle corps, to which I suppose Nial to have belonged, was under
the immediate guidance of the gallant Colborne.</p>

<p>Captain Batty’s description of the Passage of the Bidasoa, with
which operation, the first in which he shared, he commences his
<cite>Campaign of the Western Pyrenees</cite>, is very animated, and illustrated
by spirited etchings of the event of the Passage and of
Pyrenean scenery. His view of Fuenterrabia and of the mountain
of Jaizquibel is particularly deserving of praise. It is impossible
to describe the effect upon my feelings of going over this heroic
mountain ground from Andaye to the Louis Quatorze, from Bildox
and Mandale to the Bayonnette and Commissari, and from thence
to the greater Rhune.</p>

<p>The allusion in the commencement of this Canto to the Vale of
Baigorri refers to the rescue of an enormous amount of forage by
Mina’s Guerrilla from the French, including 2,000 sheep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The pastoral habits, to which large districts in Spain are still
addicted, cause the people to occupy five times the extent of land,
which with agricultural pursuits would be sufficient for their
maintenance. The pastoral institution of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mesta</i> encourages
the feeding of sheep, and the enormous migratory flocks of Estremadura
and elsewhere move every year some hundreds of miles,
devastating the tracts over which they pass. “By the increase of
pasture,” says Sir Thomas More, “your sheep, that are naturally
mild, may be said now to devour men, and unpeople, not only
villages, but towns.”&mdash;<cite>Utopia</cite>, book i. The invaders found their
account in this primitive system, and their entire subsistence was
derived from ready plunder. The French in their Peninsular
prowlings resembled in one other respect, as well as in their Republican
and Heathen names, the Lacedæmonians, who held a
grand hunt annually, in which the agricultural peasantry were
pursued and destroyed like wild beasts&mdash;a fact which, though
Müller questions the testimony that supports it, is as well authenticated
as any other incident in the Dorian history. The
argument, taken from the improbable inhumanity of the fact, is
refuted by the modern practices of the French in Spain and
Portugal, and in their Algerian Razzias to this hour. They
differ from the Lacedæmonians, it would seem, in this, that the
Spartans perpetrated the enormity only once a year, while the
French perform it weekly. I have seen with my own eyes the
ravages which they have left in the Peninsula, the glorious monuments
of antiquity which they have disfigured and defaced, the
desecration which they have brought upon shrine and tomb.
And, much as I may be disposed to forget and forgive, it is
not easy to suppress one’s choler amidst the mutilated glories of
Burgos, Alcobaça, and Batalha.</p>

</p>

<p class="noindent">Vimieiro is merely a village about 35 miles N.N.W. of Lisbon,
where the accommodations are so miserable that it was with difficulty
I could procure a <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">calda de gallinha</i> (boiled fowl served up
with its broth) the only thing in the shape of comfortable nourishment
which is to be had in the country parts of Portugal. The
walls referred to are therefore, as may be supposed, not turret-crowned
like Berecynthian Cybele. For the allusion to the effect
produced on the French by the sight of our Highlanders first met
by them in this battle, see Southey, <cite>Hist. Penins. War</cite>, and
Campbell, <cite>Ode for the Highland Society</cite>.</p>

</p>

<p>The Passage of the Bidasoa took place on the 7th October, a
month after the fall of San Sebastian. The morning was heavy
and louring, and the day’s work was ushered in by a thunder-storm
(already referred to) which caused the early British operations
to be happily unperceived.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO XI.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The character of Fray Beltrán, as portrayed in this Canto, is
meant to represent a portion of the extraordinary and irregular
energies which the events of the French Revolution and Invasion
produced in Spanish cloisters. It is with a view to impart variety
to my subject, that I have dwelt upon love and madness as the
shapes which Beltrán’s wild energy assumed, though political
propagandism, patriotic denunciation of the French, and even
taking up arms, were acts familiar to the Exclaustrados or expelled
inmates of religious houses, violated by the ruthless invader&mdash;often
for the purpose of converting cloisters into stables!</p>

<p>In these transactions, the French took one way of realising
Sir Thomas More’s “Happy Republic.” “In no victory do
they glory so much, as in that which is gained without bloodshed.”
They rejoiced to triumph by fraud, like the ancient
Spartans, or liker perhaps the Egyptian Harami&mdash;incorporated
for plunder. The monks and friars of the Peninsula were not all,
however, helpless. Many fled to the mountains and marshalled
or joined Guerrilla parties, and there was scarcely a Guerrilla
throughout Spain during the War of Independence that had not
some monks and friars incorporated with it. This system continues
down to the present hour, and the accession of these clerical
auxiliaries has ever thrown a sort of halo over the pursuit in a
superstitious country. “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Patria y la Religion!</i>” was a potent
cry, and the life of perpetual adventure was in the highest degree
exciting and romantic.</p>

<p>But the poetical view of the Guerrillas must be counterbalanced
by the more strictly historical view of their character. It is questionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>

whether these irregular levies did not produce nearly as
much evil as good. Candour must confess that there was as
much robbery as patriotism in the system. Amongst the leaders
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">partidas</i> personal interests were too often predominant.
Discipline under such a system is of course impossible, and each
man’s object is naturally to secure the largest share of the plunder
for himself. The leaders of the different <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">partidas</i> were terribly
jealous of each other; and one of the first exploits of Espoz y Mina,
the most distinguished of all their chiefs, was to slay the leader of
a Guerrilla band in his neighbourhood, because he plundered his
own countrymen under the mask of patriotism: he was also,
doubtless, in Mina’s way. All through Mina’s career, “he would
never suffer any <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">partida</i> but his own to be in his district.” (<cite>Life
of Mina.</cite>) The irregularity inherent in the Guerrilla system of
warfare encouraged violence, license, and disregard for the rights
of property. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">partidas</i> were an admirable instrument for
raising a whole people against the invader; but the application of
the force was subsequently misdirected, and the surprise of
Figueras was the only service of first-rate importance that they
ever performed in Spain. Their minor exploits were, however,
innumerable, and the disparaging observations of Napier, Foy,
and St. Cyr, all regular military men, are to be received with
caution.</p>

<p>The course of life of the Spanish Guerrillero, commencing often
as a soldier, then becoming a deserter, next flying to the mountains
and turning robber, and lastly turning soldier on his own
account, closely resembles the description of the Roman Spartacus
by Florus:&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ille de stipendiario Thrace miles, de milite desertor,
inde latro, deinde in honore virium gladiator.... Exercitum
percecidit ... castra delevit ... in primo agmine fortissimè
dimicans.</span>” (<em>Lib. iii. cap.</em> 30.)</p>

<p>It is not intended to palliate the numerous acts of jealousy,
hatred, treachery, and plunder, which our army sustained from
Spanish and Portuguese allies. But many important services
were rendered by the Guerrillas, and still more by the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
troops of Portugal. And, in addition to the Guerrilla chiefs, of
whom I have already noticed the principal, the regular troops of
Spain achieved some successes under the command of Castaños,
Palafox, Reding, Blake, O’Donnel, Sarsfield, Downie (these four
Generals were Irish or of Irish extraction), Albuquerque, Freyre,
Ballasteros, Longa, Giron, Mendizabal, Romana and Morillo.</p>

<p>Amongst the Portuguese officers, who distinguished themselves
in these campaigns, must be noticed with praise, besides Saldanha
and Terceira, the Condes of Amarante, Villareal, Das Antas and
Bomfim, the Freires, Lecor, Leite, Vallongo, and Talaia.</p>

<p>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Idem est beate vivere, et secundum naturam,</span>” says Seneca.
This was the great rule of the Stoic philosophy, and may likewise
be applied to Christian lovers. Tranquil wedded bliss
appears to be its consummation. This living according to
Nature will, of course, be varied in its interpretation, according to
each man’s individual temperament. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tot sensus, quot capita,</span>”
says Tertullian. And the decision of Protagoras will find too
many adherents, who conceived himself to be the only standard
of what was right and proper, and believed all things good which
seemed so to him. Christianity happily gets rid of the evanescent
and impalpable vagueness of the ancient philosophy, which slipt
through the fingers like the statues of Dædalus, and comes to our
aid with positive precept. In illustration of this vagueness the
advocates of the atomic theory as an adjunct of their system made
the chief part of man’s happiness consist in pleasure, which an
Epicurean would interpret literally to signify the enjoyments of
sense, and a Platonist would expound, properly understood, to
mean the exercise of virtue. Yet both in their philosophizing
would be probably theoretical, and their practice, as in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
instances, would be the result of temperament and impulse;
for “every man calleth that which pleaseth, and is delightful
to himself, <em>good</em>; and <em>evil</em> that which displeaseth him.” (Hobbes,
<cite>Treatise on Human Nature</cite>, c. vii.)</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE NOTES
TO CANTO XII.</h2>

<div class="notes">

<p class="noindent">The allusion at the commencement of this Canto is more especially
to the admirable regulations established and enforced while our
troops were upon the French territory. Never, since the days of
the great Gustavus, was such discipline preserved in an enemy’s
country. Captain Batty attests the excellent feeling produced
amongst the inhabitants of St. Jean de Luz and its neighbourhood
by the wonderful restraint observed by our army while stationed
there in cantonments. (<cite>Campaign of the Western Pyrenees.</cite>) The
well-known General Order of Wellington enforcing this discipline
can never be forgotten, as the brightest monument of civilized
war&mdash;perhaps in certain circumstances an inevitable calamity, but
by him softened to the smallest infliction of injury. An official
letter written from Bayonne, and quoted by Napier, book xxiv.
chap. 1, contains this splendid testimony;&mdash;“The English general’s
policy, and the good discipline he maintains, do us more harm
than ten battles. Every peasant wishes to be under his protection.”</p>

<p>The principal battles are described in the order of their occurrence,
and my impressions from recent visits are here recorded.</p>

<p>The ravines which intersect the heights of Roriça are overgrown
with the beautiful shrubs, which make the wild districts of Portugal
so delightful. The arbutus and myrtle I noted especially. Near
the top of the middle pass is a small opening in the form of a
wedge, nearly covered with these shrubs, where the severest fighting
took place. The principal column in the main attack advanced
under cover of some olive and cork trees, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ilex</i> of the text. The
name of this battle-ground (as remarked in my Introduction) has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
been frequently disfigured in English accounts. “Rolissa” is a common
form of error; and the usual, but absurdly erroneous, form
was for many years, “Roleia.” The true reading is that in the
text. This battle was fought on the 17th August, 1808.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the ground, both at Vimieiro and at Roriça,
struck me as only inferior to that of the terrible Serra of Busaco,
and the still more gigantic inequalities of the Pyrenees. In front
of the little village of Vimieiro, sweetly situated in a valley watered
by the silver stream of Maceira, rises a rugged and detached
flat-topped hill, commanding the passes which stretch to the south
and east. A fearful ravine, the scene of great carnage, separates
a mountain, that sweeps in a crescent from the coast, from another
range of heights over which passes the road from Vimieiro to
Lourinham, and which returns to the coast with a sudden bend
backwards, terminating there in a tall and precipitous cliff. The
ground between the points where the two armies were posted is
wooded and broken in an extraordinary degree, especially by the
deep ravine above referred to, where Brennier was for a considerable
time entangled. Kellerman’s reserves were posted in a pine wood.
Our 43rd regiment, stationed amongst some vineyards, covered
with ripening grapes, to which allusion is made in the text, for
the battle was fought on the 21st August, 1808, maintained a fierce
contest against the French grenadiers, whom they eventually
scattered with a furious onset of the bayonet, the regiment suffering
severely. On the crest of the ridge Solignac was equally defeated;
the French artillery, taken and rescued for a time, were
finally retaken, and their discomfited troops compelled to retreat.</p>

<p>The glorious battle of Talavera was fought on the 28th July,
1809, when the “burning sun” described in the text was so fierce
and scathing as to tempt the soldiers of both armies, before the
commencement of the fight, down to the little brook which separated
their positions, not far from the memorable hill which was
the vital point of the action, where they quenched their thirst
together, mingling without any attempt at mutual molestation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
with a degree of reciprocal confidence which was not without
something chivalrous in its character. I slaked my thirst at the
same stream on my visit, and could not help smiling at the remark
of a Spanish peasant, that that water to this hour is “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ensangrentada!</i>”
I pointed to its limpid purity, which assuredly had
nothing of the crimson hue. The mingling of the French and
English troops at this stream for such a purpose reminded me of a
passage in my life which occurred in 1836 at Compiègne in France,
where the late lamented Duke of Orléans had formed a camp for
military exercises, which I attended as a spectator. The heat was
likewise then intolerable, and I slaked my thirst at a streamlet on
the ground in the midst of scores of French soldiers, similarly
employed, who assisted me with great politeness. At Talavera
the French, posted near the Tagus, amongst some olive groves
which were in full bloom at the period of my visit, commenced
the battle with a tempest of bullets from no fewer than 80 pieces
of artillery. The “Belluno” alluded to in the text was Marshal
Victor, Duke of that name. “The English regiments met the
advancing columns.” “Their loud and confident shouts&mdash;sure
augury of success&mdash;were heard along the whole line.” (Napier,
<cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book viii. chap. 2.) A terrible charge of
cavalry was executed by the 23rd, down a nearly precipitous cleft,
in which half the regiment was sacrificed. The charge of the 48th
decided the day, which says Napier “was one of hard, honest
fighting,” and for which Sir Arthur Wellesley first was made a Peer.
“The battle was scarcely over when the dry grass and shrubs taking
fire, a volume of flames passed with inconceivable rapidity across
a part of the field, scorching in its course both the dead and the
wounded.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book viii. chap. 2.)</p>

<p>My first reflection, on ascending the Serra of Busaco, was one
of astonishment how any troops could act in such terrifically
broken ground. It seemed almost impracticable to my mule.
Yet up these tremendous steeps the French scaled rather than
charged with a degree of active energy and hardihood, which well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
deserves the compliment paid to them by Napier: “In this battle
of Busaco, the French, after astonishing efforts of valour, were repulsed,
in the manner to be expected from the strength of the
ground, and the goodness of the soldiers opposed to them.”
(<cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xi. chap. 7.) It was not easy in
imagination to conjure up the spectacle of these elevated crags
fronting the peaceful convent, and these crests of rugged mountains
scattered in tumbling confusion around, bristling all over with
bayonets as they did before sunrise on that eventful morning, thirty-six
years since, and the French emerging from those wooded ravines,
and rushing up the face of these fearful heights, down which they
were hurled again, their bodies strewing the way to the very
depths of the valley. A mist capped the mountain on my visit, and
it was so on the day of the battle&mdash;the 27th September, 1810.
“In less than half an hour the French were close upon the summit;
so swiftly and with such astonishing power and resolution did they
scale the mountain.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the Penins. ibid.</cite>)
“The Duke”’s despatch is, as usual, succinct and forcible.
Massena’s character, as drawn by Napoléon, was as follows:&mdash;“Brave,
decided, and intrepid * * his dispositions for battle
bad, but his temper pertinacious to the last degree.” His rashness
was here apparent. His ruthless cruelty and infamous burnings
and destruction, in retreating from the Lines of Torres
Vedras six months later, including his firing of the Convent of
Alcobaça, make the name which Napoléon gave him, “the child
of victory,” unworthy by the side of Ney, “the bravest of the
brave.”</p>

<p>The battle of Fuentes de Onoro, fought on the 5th May, 1811,
was no very decided triumph, although most undoubtedly a
victory, since the principal object of the allies, the covering of the
blockade of Almeida, was successfully accomplished. The village
of Fuentes, so often attacked throughout the day, was unflinchingly
and gallantly defended; and on the chapel and crags which
surmount the town we maintained our ground to the last, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the French retired a cannon-shot from the stream. My attention
was invited in a more lively degree by the neighbouring fortress of
Almeida, which was the scene of such repeated actions during the
Peninsular War, and where occurred the curious siege in 1844 by
the forces of the Portuguese government, when it was occupied
by a revolutionary party under the Conde do Bomfim, aiming at
the subversion of Dona Maria’s prerogative.</p>

<p>The battle of Albuera was fought on the 16th May, 1811, eleven
days after the battle of Fuentes de Onoro. At Albuera the personal
gallantry of Marshal Beresford was more conspicuous than the
generalship. Our loss in killed and wounded here was greater
than in any other action during the Peninsular War. Wellington
arrived on the field the third day after the battle. For several
days before it the Spaniards had been reduced to horse-flesh for a
subsistence! Yet on the whole they fought well. It was the
terrific charge and indomitable valour of the Fusiliers that gained
the day. Never was British infantry seen to greater advantage.
“The terrible balance hung for two hours, and twice trembling
to the sinister side, only yielded at last to the superlative vigour
of the fusiliers.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xii.
chap. 7.)</p>

<p>The assault of Ciudad Rodrigo took place on the 19th January,
1812. The success was the result of desperate valour, time not
permitting the regular approaches of scientific skill, as it was
hourly expected that Marmont would arrive to succour the town.
“Wellington resolved to storm the place without blowing in the
counterscarp; in other words, to overstep the rules of science,
and sacrifice life rather than time, for such was the capricious
nature of the Agueda that in one night a flood might enable a
small French force to relieve the place.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the
Penins.</cite> book xvi. chap. 3.) “The storming party went straight to
the breach, which was so contracted that a gun placed lengthwise
across the top nearly blocked up the opening. * * The audacious
manner in which Wellington stormed the redoubt of Francisco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and broke ground on the first night of the investment; the
more audacious manner in which he assaulted the place before the
fire of the defence had been in any manner lessened, * * were
the true causes of the sudden fall of the place. * * When the
general terminated his order for the assault with this sentence,
‘Ciudad Rodrigo must be stormed this evening,’ he knew well
that it would be nobly understood.” (<em>Ibid.</em>) The vital contest
lasted only a few minutes, but cost the gallant Crawfurd’s
life. “Throwing off the restraints of discipline, the troops
committed frightful excesses. The town was fired in three
or four places, the soldiers menaced their officers, and shot
each other; many were killed in the market-place, intoxication
soon increased the tumult, disorder everywhere prevailed,
and at last, the fury rising to an absolute madness, a fire was
wilfully lighted in the middle of the great magazine, when the
town and all in it would have been blown to atoms, but for
the energetic courage of some officers and a few soldiers who still
preserved their senses.” (<em>Ibid.</em>) It is fit that the glories of War
should have hung up by their side this pendent picture of its
Hellish atrocities and horrors. The “frightful excesses” are here
but imperfectly detailed. Neither age nor sex was spared from
any description of outrage; and it was against the Spanish people
unarmed, helpless, and allies, that these villanies of unbridled
passion were committed. Warlike ambition contains within it
the germs of every crime; and War itself, unless purely defensive
and inevitable, is the concentration of all malignity.</p>

<p>The approach to Badajoz from the side of Elvas is exceedingly
interesting. The Portuguese fortress of Elvas is perched on a lofty
hill, with the valley at its foot which separates it at the distance
of three leagues from Badajoz and the mountains of the Spanish
frontier. I was struck by the contrast between the warm and
cultivated quintas on the Elvas side, and the bleakness on that of
Badajoz. The sun had just risen over the hills of Spanish Estremadura,
which clad in the deepest purple were boldly yet delicately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
limned along the sky. The road was covered with numberless screeching
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carros</i>, and the whistling contrabandists and sturdy almocrebes
conducting their mules in listless silence formed a wonderful
contrast with my thoughts, which were full of the ‘pride, pomp,
and circumstance’ of War. When I entered Badajoz, which I
did from the side of Madrid, I could not help shuddering at
the sight of those walls which, little more than thirty years
back, witnessed so terrible a conflict&mdash;“a combat,” says Napier
“so fiercely fought, so terribly won, so dreadful in all its circumstances,
that posterity can scarcely be expected to credit the
tale; but many are still alive who know that it is true.” (<cite>Hist.
War in the Penins.</cite> book xvi. chap. 5.) The courage of Philippon
and the garrison was of the highest order. The assault combined
escalade and storm, and took place in the night of the 6th April,
1812. For a detailed description of this wonderful and terrific
scene I must refer to Napier’s History, whose magnificent narrative
it is impossible to abridge. “The ramparts crowded with
dark figures and glittering arms were seen on the one side, and on
the other the red columns of the British, deep and broad, were
coming on like streams of burning lava; * * a crash of thunder
followed, and with incredible violence the storming parties were
dashed to pieces by the explosion of hundreds of shells and powder-barrels.”
(Napier, <em>ibid.</em>) “Now a multitude bounded up the great
breach as if driven by a whirlwind, but across the top glittered a
range of sword-blades, sharp-pointed, keen-edged on both sides,
and firmly fixed in ponderous beams, which were chained together
and set deep in the ruins; and fourteen feet in front, the ascent was
covered with loose planks, studded with sharp iron points, on which
the feet of the foremost being set the planks moved, and the unhappy
soldiers, falling forward on the spikes, rolled down upon the
ranks behind.” (<em>Ibid.</em>) “Two hours spent in these vain efforts
convinced the soldiers that the breach of the Trinidad was impregnable.
* * Gathering in dark groups, and leaning on their
muskets, they looked up with sullen desperation, while the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
stepping out on the ramparts, and aiming their shot by the light
of the fire-balls which they threw over, asked, as their victims
fell, <em>Why they did not come into Badajoz?</em>” (<em>Ibid.</em>) Five thousand
men fell during the siege, of whom 3,500 were struck
during the assault. Five generals were wounded. More than
2,000 men fell at the breaches! Philippon surrendered early
next morning. To the heroic Picton and his “fighting third”
division the success was chiefly attributable. “Now commenced
that wild and desperate wickedness, which tarnished
the lustre of the soldier’s heroism. All indeed were not alike,
for hundreds risked and many lost their lives in striving to stop
the violence, but the madness generally prevailed, and as the worst
men were leaders here, all the dreadful passions of human nature
were displayed. Shameless rapacity, brutal intemperance, savage
lust, cruelty, and murder, shrieks and piteous lamentations, groans,
shouts, imprecations, the hissing of fires bursting from the houses,
the crashing of doors and windows, and the reports of muskets
used in violence, resounded for two days and nights in the streets
of Badajoz! on the third, when the city was sacked, when the
soldiers were exhausted by their own excesses, the tumult rather
subsided than was quelled. The wounded men were then looked
to, the dead disposed of.” (<em>Ibid.</em>) Let this scene be for ever engraven
on our minds&mdash;let its horrors be a response to the insane
clamour for war. And, notwithstanding the glories of our Peninsular
campaigns, let us resolve that a sword we will never draw but
in defence of our own soil!</p>

<p>The ever memorable battle of Salamanca took place in the same
month of July in which three years before had been fought the
equally glorious battle of Talavera&mdash;and even in still more sultry
weather, so much so that before the engagement at Salamanca, on
one occasion when the French, pressing upon our rear, were scattered
by the bayonet, some of our men fainted with the heat. On
the eve of the battle, a terrific thunder-storm came on just as
the enemy were taking up their position. The sky was kindled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
with incessant lightnings, and through the heavy rain which subsequently
fell, the French fires could be seen along their entire
line. It is a remarkable fact that nearly every one of our chief
battles in the Peninsula was heralded by a storm, as if Nature
sympathized in the contest. That of Salamanca was fought upon
a plain surrounded by ranges of hills&mdash;one of the few open and
level tracts upon which the rival armies met in the Peninsula, which
seemed peculiarly adapted for such a struggle, bearing at opposite
and distant points two striking rocky eminences, steep and rugged,
called the Arapiles (cut out, as it were, for rival generals) on which
the left of the French and the right of the Allies were posted.
The battle of Salamanca lasted only forty minutes. It originated
in an error of Marmont’s, which Wellington seized as thus described
by Napier: “Starting up, he repaired to the high ground, and
observed their movements for some time, with a stern contentment,
for their left wing was entirely separated from the
centre. The fault was flagrant, and he fixed it with the stroke
of a thunder-bolt.” (<cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xviii.
chap. 3.)</p>

<p>The battle of Vitoria was fought on the 21st June, 1813. The
weather was rainy, and a thick curtain of vapour overspread both
armies till noon. The utter rout which the French sustained was
in great part the result of a complication of enormous faults and
errors on the part of King Joseph. The basin of Vitoria, into
which he poured not only his troops, but his parks, baggage,
convoys, stores and encumbrances of every description&mdash;is unequally
divided by the winding Zadora, and nearly ten miles long
by an average breadth of eight miles. The stream which intersects
it is narrow, and the banks very steep in parts and uniformly
rugged. Here he was utterly exposed, and to the last moment
undecided even as to a line of retreat. The line of the Ebro had
been admirably turned by Wellington, and of the strength of the
country about that river the French were by most judicious movements
deprived. Their position was liable to be taken in flank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and this advantage was mercilessly seized. My emotion here
was little short of that which I experienced on the plain of
Waterloo; for though the contest here was immeasurably more
brief, the blow was struck with matchless vigour, and likewise
on a noble battle ground. The stress of the action lay about
the heights of La Puebla. This important point by which the
river was passed and the village of Subijana de Alava having
been successively carried by the allies, as well as the bridges of
Tres Puentes, Mendoza, and Arriaga, the French hotly pressed on
all sides were forced to retire on Vitoria, when the rout ensued
which was one of the most complete in history. “It was the
wreck of a nation.” (Napier, <cite>Hist. War in the Penins.</cite> book xx.
chap. 8.) An officer who was present well expressed it thus: “The
French were beaten before the town, and in the town, and through
the town, and out of the town, and behind the town, and all round
about the town;” and Gazan, a French officer’s account was that
“they lost all their equipages, all their guns, all their treasure, all
their stores, and all their papers, so that no man could prove how
much pay was due to him.” From the total wreck even king
Joseph with difficulty escaped, a pistol-shot having been fired into
his carriage. “The trophies were innumerable,” (Napier, <em>ibid.</em>)
The spoils resembled those of an Oriental rather than an European
army; for Joseph had all his luxuries and treasures with him.
Five millions and a half of dollars were stated by the French
accounts to have been in the money-chests. Our troops had
abundant spoil, for “not one dollar,” says Napier, “came to
the public.” A profusion was found of the choicest wines and
delicacies, the baggage was rifled, and our soldiers attired themselves
in the gala dresses of the enemy. Marshal Jourdan’s
bâton was taken by the 87th regiment. “The Duke”’s despatch
is excellent.</p>

those fought upon the soil of France up to the gates of Toulouse,

<p>With regard to the Lines of Torres Vedras, the testimony of
Colonel (since General) Jones, an eminent engineer officer, whose
writings are of the plainest and most practical character, and who
evidently had little imagination to incite him to enthusiasm, is as
follows:&mdash;“The lines in front of Lisbon are a triumph to the
British nation. They are without doubt the finest specimen of a
fortified position ever effected. From their peninsular situation
there is no possibility of manœuvring on the flanks, cutting off the
supplies, or getting in the rear of them: in the details of the
work there is no pedantry of science; nor long lines of fortification
for show without strength; mountains themselves are made the
prominent points; the gorges alone derive their total strength
from retrenchments. The quantity of labour bestowed on them
is incredible, but in no part has the engineer done more than his
duty; assisted nature, assisted the general, and assisted the
troops, and for each arm has procured a favourable field of
action.” (<cite>Journals of the Sieges undertaken by the Allies in
Spain</cite>, note 1.) I have frequently witnessed at Lisbon the excitement
of French military travellers about these works. Their
first rush from Lisbon is to Torres Vedras and the neighbourhood
to see them; and their admiration, although a little
bitterly, is always freely expressed. The testimony of a distinguished
French general is equally explicit:&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce monument
remarquable de l’industrie de nos ennemis, les lignes construites
en 1810 pour la defence de Lisbonne.</span>” (Foy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. Guerre.
Pénins.</cite> liv. ii.)</p>

<p>The modes of warfare and the structure of society have undergone
such an utter change that it appears delusive to seek any
parallel for the achievements of Wellington in the records of ancient
history. The naked fact that he had to contend against the
incomparable military genius of Napoléon, and without any exaggeration
became “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le vainqueur du vainqueur du monde</i>” attests in
the severe sobriety of History more than the most fulsome adulation.
All the great conquerors of the ancient world&mdash;Sesostris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Alexander, Hannibal, Cæsar&mdash;were invaders: Wellington’s battles
were nearly all defensive of human rights and liberty. In Roman
annals he may be most fittingly compared to Scipio Africanus, the
conqueror of Hannibal&mdash;the more especially for the purity of both
their characters. In Grecian history he might be likened to
Themistocles, who also maintained a glorious defensive war, but
that the English, unlike the Greek hero, was incorruptible. His
character is a compound of the two great joint rulers of Athens&mdash;of
the military conduct of Themistocles and the inflexible justice of
Aristides. The admirable strokes of policy by which Themistocles
circumvented Xerxes might be paralleled in several parts of Wellington’s
career, who like Themistocles could lead his foes astray
as well as rout them at Salamis. There is one part of the
Athenian’s character, his venality, over which the Englishman
towers with transcendent superiority. There is another, and
curious particular, in which the comparison is likewise to his
advantage. Themistocles was unskilled in music, and therefore
by his contemporaries (who prized that art so highly) twitted with
ignorance, as Cicero informs us. (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tusc. Quest. lib.</cite> i.) Plutarch,
(<em>lib.</em> i.) and Athenæus (<em>lib.</em> xiv.) mention that those who were unskilled
in the harp were forced jocosely to sing to the accompaniment
of a branch of laurel or myrtle held in a cithara-like
form, as we sometimes now-a-days see a wag perform a tune with
poker and bellows. The ancients in their banquets were in the
habit of sending round the lyre to each of the guests in succession,
an event of which kind caused Themistocles to be found wanting,
from whence Quintilian (<em>lib.</em> i. cap. 16) takes occasion to inculcate
on his pupils the necessity of learning music. The same practice
prevailed amongst our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, at whose feasts the
harp was sent round in a precisely similar manner. (Bede, <cite>Hist.
Eccles. Anglor.</cite> iv. 24.) The Duke of Wellington’s love of music
is inherited from his accomplished father, the Earl of Mornington,
and his Directorship of the Ancient Concerts proves that he is not
more devoted to Mars than to Apollo.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
